🚨 MASTER REPLIT PROMPT — MINISTRYPATH FULL ALIGNMENT & COMPLETION

ROLE
You are a senior product engineer and systems architect.

This project is MinistryPath, a church leadership and discipleship platform.

Your job is to align the existing codebase to the stated intent, not to invent features.

⚠️ Do NOT ask questions.
⚠️ Do NOT redesign UI unless explicitly instructed.
⚠️ Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
⚠️ Do NOT add libraries or abstractions.
⚠️ Do NOT rebuild systems that already exist.

Work incrementally, deterministically, and stop when all objectives are met.

🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES (READ CAREFULLY)

Passing a quiz must NEVER complete a training

Completion requires explicit leader approval

UI must never imply readiness or clearance prematurely

Outlook 365 is the calendar of record (read + write)

Planning Center is NOT replaced

Assume a non-technical admin — safety over flexibility

Favor subtraction over addition

PHASE 1 — HARDEN TRAINING LIFECYCLE (DO FIRST)
Enforce this exact state machine everywhere:
NOT_STARTED
IN_PROGRESS
SUBMITTED_FOR_REVIEW
APPROVED
REJECTED
COMPLETED   ← ONLY AFTER APPROVAL

REQUIRED CHANGES

Locate ALL quiz submission handlers

Remove or block any logic that:

Marks training as complete on quiz pass

Auto-advances user to completion

Quiz submission must:

Record score

Set status → SUBMITTED_FOR_REVIEW

Completion can ONLY occur via leader action

UI COPY & BEHAVIOR

Replace “Quiz Passed” completion language with:

“Quiz submitted for review”

Remove:

Trophies

“Continue” implying clearance

Display status clearly:

Awaiting Leader Approval

PHASE 2 — UNIFIED MEMBER EXPERIENCE (“MY PATH”)
Create ONE primary dashboard: My Path

This replaces:

MyDiscipleship

Journey

Progress

Classes (as separate destinations)

My Path must:

Aggregate:

Trainings + approval status

Required classes

Roles + readiness

Answer plainly:

What am I cleared for?

What is waiting on approval?

What is my next step?

RULES

Reuse existing components and data

Do NOT redesign UI

Redirect legacy routes to My Path

PHASE 3 — LEADER APPROVAL AS PASTORAL ACTION
Leader approvals must:

Be scoped ONLY to ministries the leader oversees

Never be global unless explicitly authorized

Show context:

Person

Role

Training

Use pastoral language:

“Approve” → “Affirm Readiness”

“Reject” → “Needs Follow-Up”

Require intentional confirmation (no accidental clicks)

PHASE 4 — OUTLOOK 365 CALENDAR (SYSTEM OF RECORD)
Core Rule

Outlook is canonical. MinistryPath reflects it.

Implement READ + WRITE using Microsoft Graph
API Endpoints (minimal, safe)

GET /api/outlook/events?start&end&filters

POST /api/outlook/events

PATCH /api/outlook/events/:id

DELETE /api/outlook/events/:id

Permissions

Members: read-only

Leaders/Admin: write (default to stricter permissions)

Calendar Metadata (for filtering)

Persist category data inside Outlook events, using ONE strategy:

Prefer Graph event categories

Fallback: structured metadata stored as:

<!-- MINISTRYPATH_META: { 
  category: "Mens Ministry",
  group: "Regular Sunday",
  ministryId: "...",
  createdByMinistryPath: true
} -->

Supported Filters

Men’s Ministry

Women’s Ministry

Sunday Services

Regular / Special / Super Sundays

Other ministry categories as defined

Filters must:

Apply to Outlook-sourced events

Persist in localStorage

PHASE 5 — ROOM RESERVATIONS (THIN SLICE)

Use Outlook resource calendars

Admin config defines which resources are available

Booking flow:

Select room

Select time

Check conflicts

Create Outlook event

No complex approvals yet

Clear success/failure messaging

PHASE 6 — GUIDED “NEXT STEP” COACH BUBBLES
Create reusable component: CoachBubble

Features:

Short title

1–2 sentences

Optional CTA button

Dismissible

Dismissal stored per user via localStorage

Usage (minimum)

My Path

Awaiting approval explanation

Missing classes guidance

No role selected → where to go

Training Viewer

Quiz submitted → what happens next

Rejected → next action

Calendar

How filtering works

Outlook is the source of truth

Rules

One bubble max per page

Show once unless reset

Never nag

PHASE 7 — REMOVE OR HIDE DISTRACTIONS

Hide from navigation (do not delete unless necessary):

XP Dashboard

Redundant surveys

Extra dashboards

Metrics as primary destination

PHASE 8 — ADMIN SAFETY GUARDRAILS

Implement:

Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

Disable direct dangerous edits

Safe defaults everywhere

No irreversible actions without confirmation

Think Squarespace-lite, not developer console.

EXECUTION RULES

Execute phases in order

No pauses

No clarifying questions

Minimal code changes

Stop only when all phases are complete

DEFINITION OF DONE

Quiz pass ≠ completion

Leader approval required for completion

One clear member dashboard

Outlook calendar read/write works

Filters function correctly

Room booking works

Users are gently guided

App feels calmer, safer, and harder to misuse

BEGIN NOW.
RUN CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL COMPLETE.
DO NOT STOP EARLY.
