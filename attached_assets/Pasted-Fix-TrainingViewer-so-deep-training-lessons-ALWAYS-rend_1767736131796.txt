Fix TrainingViewer so deep training lessons ALWAYS render for deep trainings.

PROBLEM:
All trainings show the generic fallback screen:
"Lesson Overview... When you're ready, submit this training for leader review. Submit for Review"
This is happening because TrainingViewer only renders deep training when:
if (isDeepTraining && currentLesson)
and currentLesson is derived from lessons[currentLessonIndex].
If currentLessonIndex is undefined/out of range at render time, currentLesson is falsy and the UI falls back, even though lessons exist.

SOURCE EVIDENCE:
- TrainingViewer gate requires (isDeepTraining && currentLesson)
- lessons are confirmed present in DB and API response for deep trainings

REQUIREMENTS (NO DIALOG):
1) In client/src/pages/member/TrainingViewer.tsx:
   A) Ensure the deep training check uses the parsed lessons array:
      const isDeepTraining = module?.isDeepTraining === true && parsedLessons.length > 0;
      const lessons = parsedLessons;

   B) Introduce a safe lesson index:
      const safeLessonIndex =
        typeof currentLessonIndex === "number" &&
        currentLessonIndex >= 0 &&
        currentLessonIndex < lessons.length
          ? currentLessonIndex
          : 0;

      const currentLesson = lessons[safeLessonIndex];

   C) Change the render decision:
      - If isDeepTraining is true, render deep training view.
      - Do NOT require currentLesson to be truthy to enter deep training view.
      - If lessons length is 0, THEN fallback.

2) Submission guard:
   - Ensure "Submit for Review" is NOT shown immediately for deep trainings.
   - Only show submission after the deep training flow reaches completion criteria
     (at minimum: last lesson completed; if the system requires knowledge check or assessment, require those too).

3) System-wide:
   - This fix must apply to ALL deep trainings (Recruitment 101, Baptism Handout, etc.) via the same TrainingViewer.
   - Do not add new endpoints or schema.

4) Verification steps:
   - Confirm Recruitment 101 now opens to Lesson 1 of 8 with lesson title/content and Next Lesson works
   - Confirm Baptism Handout does the same
   - Confirm the generic fallback is only used when lessons truly do not exist
   - Confirm Submit for Review is not visible at start of deep trainings

After implementing:
- Provide a short summary of what was changed and the files modified.
- Stop.
