MinistryPath – Profile, Ministries, Invitations, and Login Updates
(Add/modify these features to the existing app – do not rebuild from scratch.)
1. Profile Creation & Ministry Selection Logic
A. Role-Based Profile Behavior
Update the profile creation flow to behave differently depending on the user’s role:
Pastors & Leaders
On profile creation, pastors and leaders must:
Select which ministries they specifically lead.
These ministries define:
Which teams they have oversight of.
Which training modules and admin views they see in the app.
Dream Team Members (Volunteers)
On profile creation, Dream Team members must:
Select which ministries they serve in,
unless they joined the app through an invitation that already specifies a ministry (see below).
These selected ministries:
Determine which manuals and trainings populate under My Trainings.
Determine which leaders can view their progress.
2. Invitations & Requesting to Join Ministries
A. Invitation with Pre-Selected Ministry
When a pastor/leader invites a new user into the app, they can:
Attach one or more specific ministries to that invitation.
When the invited user accepts:
Those ministries should already be selected on their profile.
The user should not need to re-select them to get started.
B. Request to Join Other Ministries
After a user accepts an invitation and completes profile creation:
They should have the ability to request to join additional ministries from within their profile or a “Join a Ministry” section.
When they request to join another ministry:
A notification/approval request is sent to:
The ministry leader(s) of that ministry
And/or a global admin, depending on the existing permission system.
The ministry is only added to their profile after approval.
Once approved:
The appropriate ministry manual(s) and associated trainings are added automatically to My Trainings.
3. Login / Account Creation Screen Updates
Update the login screen to properly support both existing users and new users.
A. Login Screen Should Provide:
Existing User Login
Fields:
Email
Password
Button: Log In
On success: route to the main dashboard/home screen.
New Account Creation (Sign Up)
A clear option such as: “Create Account” or “New here? Sign up.”
When selected, show fields:
Username
Email
Password
(Optional) Invitation Code if your current design uses invite links/codes.
Button: Create Account
B. Approval Logic (If Required by Environment / Replit)
If the environment (e.g., Replit backend) requires manual approval for new accounts:
After a new user signs up:
Mark their account status as “Pending Approval”.
Prevent access to the full app until approved by an admin.
Admins should have a simple interface to:
View pending users
Approve or reject accounts
On approval:
The user receives access based on:
Their role (pastor/leader/dream team)
And initial ministries (from invitation or profile selection)
4. Important Integration Notes
Do not remove or break existing training flows, manuals, or My Trainings logic.
These changes are additive and must:
Use the existing roles system (Dream Team, Leader, Pastor).
Plug into the current training assignment logic (ministry selection → ministry manuals → My Trainings).
Any new ministries selected or approved after signup should:
Automatically attach the relevant manuals.
Automatically generate the associated training modules and surveys as already defined in the app
