Here’s a ready-to-paste prompt you can give to an AI app builder:

---

You are building a **web-based survey app** for **Garden City Church** (a Pentecostal / Spirit-filled church). The purpose of this app is to:

1. Help people identify their **spiritual gifts**
2. Suggest **best-fit ministry roles** in our church
3. Give a simple **personality profile** (Jung / Myers-Briggs–style or 4-type temperament)

The tone should be **Christ-centered, Bible-honoring, and Pentecostal-friendly** (openness to the gifts of the Spirit, without weird or extreme language).

---

## Core Goals

Design an app that:

* Asks **no more than 50 questions total**
* Combines questions about:

  * Spiritual gifts
  * Personality traits
  * Ministry interests and capacity
* Produces:

  * A short **spiritual gifts summary**
  * A simple **personality type** summary
  * A list of **top ministry recommendations** at Garden City Church

---

## Ministries to Match

The app should map survey results to **specific ministries** we use at Garden City Church:

* **First Impressions / Landing Team**

  * Greeters
  * Welcome / Guest Table (first-time guests, gifts, connection cards)
* **Ushers**
* **Security**
* **Transportation**
* **Café / Hospitality (Gift of Helps, Service)**
* **Facilities / Setup / Cleaning**
* **Worship Team**
* **Media / Production**

  * Sound
  * Lyrics / ProPresenter
  * Live stream / video / basic editing
* **Creative Arts**

  * Visual art
  * Graphic design
  * Dance
  * Drama / spoken word
  * Photography / videography
* **Teaching / Discipleship**

  * Adult Bible studies / Discipleship Hour
* **Youth Ministry**
* **Children’s Ministry (Kingdom Children)**
* **Nursery**
* **Young Adults**
* **Outreach / Evangelism / Community Service**

> **Important:**
> For **Worship**, **Media**, and **Creative Arts**, build in questions that **verify real skill and experience** (not just interest). For example:
>
> * “Can you confidently play an instrument or sing in front of others?”
> * “How many years have you practiced ___?”
> * “Have you ever served on a worship or media team before?”
> * “Can you provide a simple portfolio / sample of your work?” (graphics, video, etc.)

If a person **lacks skill** but has **interest**, the app should:

* Suggest **“growth pathway”** language such as:

  * “You may not be ready to serve in Worship/Media yet, but you could explore lessons, shadowing, or training.”

## Spiritual Gifts to Detect

Include questions to identify tendencies in gifts such as:

* Prophecy / Encouraging, truth-telling, sensing God’s direction
* Teaching / Explaining Scripture
* Shepherding / Pastoral care / Nurturing people
* Evangelism / Boldness to share the Gospel
* Discernment / Spiritual sensitivity
* Administration / Organization / Planning
* Leadership / Vision / Initiative
* Serving / Helps / Practical support
* Mercy / Compassion / Care for the hurting
* Giving / Generosity / Resourcing ministry
* Hospitality / Welcoming / Hosting
* Intercession / Prayer burden

Each response should contribute weighted scores to **multiple gifts**, then rank the top 3–5 gifts at the end.

---

## Personality Layer

Add a **lightweight personality profile** based on either a **4-type temperament** or a simplified **Jung / Myers-Briggs-style** approach.

Focus on traits such as:

* Introvert / Extrovert
* People-focused vs. Task-focused
* Detail-oriented vs. Big-picture
* Structured vs. Flexible
* Emotionally expressive vs. Reserved

Use these traits to help fine-tune ministry suggestions. For example:

* High extrovert + hospitality → First Impressions / Greeters / Café
* Detail-oriented + steady → Facilities, Media, Administration, Security
* Nurturing + patient → Children, Nursery, Follow-up care
* Bold + evangelistic → Outreach, Street evangelism, Youth, Young Adults

---

## Question Design

Total: **Under 50 questions**. Use a mix of:

* **Likert scale** (Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree)
* **Multiple choice**
* A few **Yes/No** or **True/False**

Organize them roughly into 4 sections:

1. **Spiritual Gifts & Ministry Preferences** (20–25 questions)

   * Example themes:

     * Comfort level praying with others
     * Desire to teach / explain the Bible
     * Enjoyment of serving behind the scenes
     * Desire to share faith with strangers
     * Sensitivity to spiritual atmosphere / discernment
     * Willingness to lead vs. support
     * Desire to care for children, youth, hurting people

2. **Personality & Working Style** (10–15 questions)

   * Example themes:

     * Energy from people vs. solitude
     * Preference for structure vs. spontaneity
     * Comfort with conflict / leadership
     * Attention to detail vs. big-picture thinking

3. **Skills & Experience** (5–10 questions)
   Include **conditional questions**:

   * “Do you play an instrument or sing?”
   * “How many years of experience do you have?”
   * “Have you served on worship/media/children’s teams before?”
   * “Are you comfortable using technology (slides, cameras, sound boards)?”

4. **Availability & Capacity** (3–5 questions)

   * Time availability (weekly / monthly)
   * Comfort with early mornings, evenings, Sundays, events

---

## Scoring & Output

At the end of the survey, the app should:

1. Generate a **Spiritual Gifts Summary**

   * Show top 3–5 gifts with simple descriptions.
   * Example format:

     * “Primary Gift: Teaching – You enjoy explaining God’s Word clearly and helping people understand truth.”

2. Provide a **Personality Snapshot**

   * Short type name (e.g., “People-Oriented Encourager,” “Organized Servant-Leader”)
   * 2–3 bullet points describing how they typically show up in a team.

3. Recommend **Top Ministry Fits at Garden City Church**

   * Show **3–5 recommended ministries**, each with:

     * Ministry name
     * Short description of what serving there looks like
     * Why they were matched (based on gifts/personality/skills)

4. Optionally list **Secondary Options**

   * “You may also be a good fit for: [list]”

Make the language **encouraging, faith-filled, and practical**, e.g.:

> “Based on your responses, you seem to have a strong gift of Helps and Hospitality, with a warm, people-oriented personality. You might thrive serving on our First Impressions Team, Café/Hospitality Team, or Outreach. These roles let you welcome people, make them feel at home, and show the love of Jesus in practical ways.”

## Authentication & Data

**User Accounts / Resume Feature**

* Allow users to **create a simple account** (email + password, or social login).
* Allow them to **save progress** and **resume later** if they don’t finish in one sitting.

**Upon Completion**

* Automatically **email the full results** to the participant:

  * Spiritual gifts summary
  * Personality snapshot
  * Ministry recommendations
* Also **store the results** in the app’s database with:

  * Name
  * Email
  * Phone (optional)
  * Date completed
  * Their gifts/personality/ministry matches

Ideally include a way for admins to export results (e.g., CSV) or view them in an admin dashboard, but that’s secondary.

---

## UX & Style Notes

* Design should feel **warm, modern, and welcoming**, not corporate.
* Use language a **new or growing believer** can understand (avoid heavy jargon).
* Let users know at the start:

  * This tool is **not a prophecy**, but a **helpful guide**.
  * Final placement will be through **conversation with a pastor or ministry leader**.

At the end, display a **friendly next step**, like:

> “Thank you for completing the Garden City Church Ministry & Spiritual Gifts Survey! A copy of your results has been emailed to you. A leader from our team may reach out to help you take your next step in serving. In the meantime, feel free to share your results with a pastor or ministry leader you trust.”

Build the entire app logic (survey questions, scoring system, personality mapping, and ministry recommendations) according to the specs above.
