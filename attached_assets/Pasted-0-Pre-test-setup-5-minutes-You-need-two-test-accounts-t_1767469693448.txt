0) Pre-test setup (5 minutes)

You need two test accounts + two ministries.

Create ministries: Worship, Men’s

Accounts:

Leader A (leader of Worship)

Member 1 (assigned to Worship)

Optional: Member 2 (assigned to Men’s)

Confirm Admin System Status panel shows:

DB: ✅

Outlook: ✅

Email/Mailgun: ✅ (or “fallback mode” clearly indicated)

If Email is not ✅, you can still test in-app notifications, but don’t publish until email is sorted (since leader workflow depends on it).

1) Critical loop: Training lifecycle cannot lie (15 minutes)
Steps

Log in as Member 1

Start a training that requires approval

Take quiz and PASS

Must be true (PASS conditions)

Training status becomes SUBMITTED_FOR_REVIEW (or equivalent label)

It does NOT show “Completed”

No “you’re cleared / keep going” language

CoachBubble says submitted for review

Log in as Leader A

Verify you received:

In-app notification (clickable, goes to the right place)

Email notification (subject/body includes member name + ministry)

Leader approves (“Affirm Readiness”)

Log back in as Member 1

Training now shows Completed (only after approval)

Repeat rejection test

Submit another training (or re-submit a rejected flow)

Leader marks “Needs follow-up”

Member sees:

status: Rejected/Needs follow-up

bubble explains what to do next

cannot be marked completed until resubmitted + approved

If any part auto-completes early → do not publish.

2) Leader awareness loop: Team join + My Team view (10 minutes)
Steps

Invite Member 2 to Worship

Accept invite as Member 2

PASS conditions

Leader A receives:

Email: “New person joined your team … (Worship)”

In-app notification with link

Leader A goes to Leadership → My Team

Member 2 appears

shows onboarding status + training status counts

CoachBubble does not spam or overlap

3) Outlook category round-trip (15 minutes)
Steps

Create a new category: Outreach Night

Go to calendar filters → confirm category appears immediately

Create a new event in MinistryPath:

Title: Outreach Night Test

Apply category: Outreach Night

Save

PASS conditions

Refresh calendar → event still has category

Filter by Outreach Night → event appears

Non-MP category preservation test (important)

Open the same event in Outlook and add a normal Outlook category (not MP:)

Update the event title in MinistryPath

Check in Outlook: the non-MP category is still there

If MinistryPath wipes non-MP categories → do not publish (that’s how you lose trust fast).

4) Room booking conflict detection (10 minutes)
Steps

Book a room for 10:00–11:00

Try booking again for 10:30–11:30

PASS conditions

Second booking fails with 409 conflict

Response includes clear conflict details

UI shows a human-readable message (“Conflicts with X from 10:00–11:00”)

If you have an approval step, conflict is re-checked at approval time too

Publish recommendation

✅ If all 4 flows pass, publish and start with a pilot:

2 leaders

5–10 members

2 ministries
for one week.

If anything fails, paste the failing step + screenshot/snippet and I’ll tell you exactly what to adjust.

If you want Replit to “help test” (you can paste this)

Tell Replit AI:

“Don’t build anything else. Create a TESTING_CHECKLIST.md in the repo with the exact steps above, plus places in the UI where each step happens, and include expected status labels. Also add a small admin-only ‘Test Data’ helper page to create sample ministries/users/invites ONLY if such a page already exists; otherwise just document how to do it via existing UI.”

That keeps cost low and makes testing repeatable.
