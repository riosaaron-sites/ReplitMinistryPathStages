MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 4.1
ONBOARDING GATE FIXES (PHOTO SHOULD NOT BLOCK) + SMOKE TEST ENABLEMENT
STOP AFTER REPORT

You completed Phase 4. Proceed to Phase 4.1 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign onboarding UI yet (that is Phase 5).
- Do NOT change dashboard features (already implemented).
- Do NOT change training generation.
- Only adjust onboarding gating rules so the system is testable and user-friendly.
- STOP after Phase 4.1 report.

GOALS
1) Ensure onboarding correctly gates dashboard access.
2) Ensure photo upload is NOT a hard blocker for reaching the dashboard unless explicitly required.
3) Enable smoke testing of dashboard + training + discipleship flows.

REQUIREMENTS
A) PhotoStep behavior:
- Photo upload must be OPTIONAL with a clear “Skip for now” button.
- If a photo is missing, show a gentle reminder later (profile card).
- If you must keep a “photo required” option, make it configurable and OFF by default.

B) Onboarding state machine:
- Confirm OnboardingController state progression works without forcing photo.
- Ensure users can reach DONE state without photo.

C) Feature gating:
- Dashboard is inaccessible until onboarding is complete (still true).
- But onboarding completion must not depend on photo.

D) Add a lightweight admin/test bypass for local verification:
- A safe, admin-only tool to mark a test account onboarding as complete
- OR allow “developer test mode” in non-production
This is ONLY for verification, not normal users.

E) Run smoke tests after changes:
- Confirm: user can complete onboarding without photo
- Confirm: lands on dashboard
- Confirm: My Trainings works
- Confirm: Completed training reopen works
- Confirm: MyDiscipleship opens and expands
- Confirm: What’s Next routes to correct next action

PHASE 4.1 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)
1) PHOTO STEP CHANGE
- what changed
- how user skips

2) ONBOARDING FLOW CONFIRMATION
- user can reach onboarding DONE without photo (yes/no)

3) ADMIN/TEST BYPASS (if added)
- what it is
- how it is restricted

4) SMOKE TEST RESULTS
- onboarding completion (pass/fail)
- dashboard access (pass/fail)
- trainings hub (pass/fail)
- completed training review (pass/fail)
- discipleship page (pass/fail)

End with:
“Phase 4.1 complete. Onboarding gate is now sane. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 5.”
STOP.
