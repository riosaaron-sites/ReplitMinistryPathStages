FULL APP REVISION PROMPT (UPDATED SURVEY LOGIC + EXPANDED MINISTRY FILTERS)
For Garden City Church Ministry Assessment & Spiritual Gifts Survey
1. Keep ALL Existing Features, Logic, Storage, Emails, Branding, and PDF Rendering
Do not remove or break:
* Spiritual gift logic
* Personality-type logic
* Ministry recommendations
* Conditional logic
* Email automations
* Branding requirements
* Assessment storage
* Retroactive email sending
* PDFs
* All previously implemented instructions
All of this remains fully intact. This prompt only strengthens the question logic, qualification filters, and precision of assessment pathways.

2. New Sex Identification Logic (Mandatory First Step)
Immediately after name/email:
Ask: “Please Select your Sex.” Options (STRICTLY):
* Male
* Female
No other options permitted.
If “Male” is selected:
* Bypass and permanently hide all questions relating to:
    * Nursery
    * Infants
    * Toddlers
* Remove these ministry paths from ALL possible recommendation lists for men.
* Still allow male participants to be evaluated for:
    * Children (non-nursery), depending on logic
    * Youth
    * All other ministries
* Still provide a full assessment and PDF summary.

3. Children’s Ministry Qualification Logic
Goal:
Accurately filter out individuals who are not ready, qualified, appropriate, or temperamentally matched for serving with children.
This requires more precise, more detailed, and more thorough questioning. The app is now authorized to ask up to 150 questions to achieve this precision.
New children’s ministry filter categories:
Include questions that assess:
* Comfort level working with children
* Patience
* Safety awareness
* Trauma sensitivity
* History with childcare (formal or informal)
* Emotional regulation
* Experience in structured environments
* Ability to follow safety protocols
* Clean CORI/DSS history (do NOT collect details—just ask if they can pass one)
* Physical capability to lift, carry, or assist children safely
* Ability to work under a leader
Disqualifying logic (soft, pastoral, but firm):
If someone:
* Indicates low patience
* Gets easily overwhelmed
* Has no desire to work with kids
* Indicates discomfort with safety protocols
* Cannot pass background requirements
* Expresses frustration toward children behaviors
* Dislikes structured classroom settings
* Cannot follow direction from a leader
* Has difficulty managing stress
* Prefer not to work with minors
→ Quietly remove them from ALL children’s ministry recommendation pathways. They will still receive a full assessment and be guided toward other ministries.

4. Youth Ministry Qualification Logic
Add deeper questions focused on:
* Emotional maturity
* Boundaries
* Ability to handle sensitive conversations
* Trauma awareness
* Leadership under authority
* Ability to model Christian maturity
* Avoiding spiritual manipulation
* Communication skills
* Responsibility level
* Reliability
* Digital wisdom (social media boundaries)
* Temperament (avoid hot-headed or impulsive behaviors)
If responses indicate:
* Lack of maturity
* Boundary issues
* Strong discomfort
* Poor communication skills
* Impulsivity
* Low responsibility
* Low interest
→ Remove youth ministry from their recommendations.

5. Add New Ministry Pathways (with filtering logic)
You will now integrate three additional ministry opportunities into the assessment results:
A. GriefShare (Support Group Ministry)
Phrase recommendation as: “You might be a good fit for GriefShare.”
Add questions that evaluate:
* Compassion levels
* Empathy
* Emotional stability
* Ability to listen without fixing
* Comfort with people in pain
* Respect for confidentiality
* Spiritual maturity
* Reliability
* Ability to follow curriculum
* Comfort discussing sensitive subjects
DO NOT automatically qualify anyone for leadership. But DO create a path that says: “Based on your responses, you may eventually qualify to pursue leadership in GriefShare, pending further training and pastoral review.”

B. Celebrate Recovery (CR)
Phrase recommendation as: “You might be a good fit for Celebrate Recovery.”
Add screening questions for:
* Vulnerability
* Transparency
* Accountability
* Understanding personal boundaries
* Respect for confidentiality
* Spiritual maturity
* Willingness to follow structure
* Reliability
* A heart to support others without control
Leadership pathway messaging: “Your responses suggest you have qualities that could be developed into future Celebrate Recovery leadership, pending required steps and pastoral approval.”

C. The Landing Team (Assimilation Team)
This team includes:
* Greeters
* First Impressions
* Community Care Team (emails, cards, texts, calls)
Add questions to evaluate:
* Warmth in communication
* Hospitality
* Attention to detail
* Ability to follow up
* Consistency
* People skills
* Phone comfort
* Ability to handle diverse personalities
* Joyful demeanor
* Reliability
* Courtesy
Recommendation phrasing: “You might be a good fit for The Landing Team.”

6. Strengthen General Ministry Logic
Ensure the system:
* Avoids recommending ministries the participant is unfit for.
* Offers multiple alternative pathways if they are disqualified from one area.
* Keeps tone pastoral, encouraging, and uplifting—even when redirecting.
Example redirection: “Based on your responses, it seems your gifts may be better suited for other ministries. Here are areas where you may thrive…”

7. Keep Existing Ministry Options BUT Strengthen Filters
For all other existing ministries (ushers, security, worship, facilities, outreach, etc.), add:
* Safety reasoning
* Schedule reliability checks
* Physical ability (for setup/breakdown)
* Musical competence (worship)
* Detail orientation (security)
* Flexibility & follow-through
No need to rewrite full modules—just expand logic and add screening questions.

8. Expand Question Bank (Authorized Up to 150 Questions)
You may add up to 150 total questions as needed to:
* Improve accuracy
* Increase ministry alignment
* Better assess temperament, spiritual maturity, gifts, and personality
* Strengthen qualification filters
* Clarify genuine desire and ability
The app should intelligently hide unnecessary questions based on earlier answers to keep the user experience clean and pastoral.

9. Maintain Pastoral Tone
Ensure all questions and disqualification logic remain:
* Warm
* Pastoral
* Clear
* Encouraging
* Free from harsh language
* Assume the best about participants
Every redirect must feel uplifting.

10. Everything Else Remains the Same
All previously written automations, logic, email sending, PDF generation, Garden City branding, and ministry-pathway logic must remain fully intact.
This prompt only enhances, expands, and refines the assessment.
