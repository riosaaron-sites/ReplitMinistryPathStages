Test Flow 1: Training lifecycle can’t lie (non-negotiable)
A) Member submits

Log in as a member

Start a training that requires approval

Take quiz and pass

Confirm the UI says:

Submitted for review

NOT completed

No “you’re cleared / continue / trophy” vibes

B) Leader reviews

Log in as the leader of that ministry

Confirm leader gets:

Email (Training Submitted)

In-app notification with a link that actually opens the review

Leader clicks approve (“Affirm readiness”)

Go back to member: confirm training becomes Completed only now

Repeat once with Rejected:

Member sees “Needs follow-up”

Leader sees it in team status

If anything in this flow is off, do not publish.

Test Flow 2: Team join → leader awareness loop

Invite a new person to a ministry (Worship, etc.)

Accept invite as that person

Confirm leader receives:

Email: “New person joined your team…”

In-app notification (clickable)

Leader opens Leadership → My Team

Confirm the new person appears with:

ministry assignment

onboarding status

training status counts

Trigger onboarding start/completion and confirm leader gets the right notifications (not spammed).

Test Flow 3: Outlook categories round-trip (MP: strategy must work)
A) New category creation

As admin, create a new category: Outreach Night

Confirm it appears in Calendar filters immediately

B) Create event in MinistryPath

Create a calendar event in MinistryPath

Assign categories including Outreach Night

Confirm it writes to Outlook

C) Verify round-trip

Refresh calendar in MinistryPath

Confirm event comes back with the same categories and filter works

D) Preserve non-MP categories

In Outlook (manually), add a non-MinistryPath category to that event

Update the event in MinistryPath (change title/time)

Confirm the non-MP category remains (MinistryPath should not wipe it)

If non-MP categories get wiped, that’s a hard no-go for deployment.

Test Flow 4: Room booking (thin slice)

As leader/admin, open room booking

Check availability for a time that should be busy

Confirm it blocks conflicts

Book a room

Confirm the booking appears on the room/resource calendar in Outlook

Publish decision

✅ Publish only after all flows above pass with:

2 ministries

2 leaders

2 members

1 new category you create

1 Outlook event you modify from Outlook directly

If you can pass that, you’re ready for a small pilot rollout (5–10 users) before a full church-wide launch.

One last thing I’d add before production (tiny but priceless)

A “System Status” panel for admin:

Outlook connection status (success/fail + last tested)

DB status

Email mode: “real email” vs “fallback mailto/copy”

This prevents you from debugging blind at 11:47pm on a Saturday. Ask me if you want the prompt for that.

If you paste your results from the four test flows (even just “passed/failed + what looked weird”), I’ll tell you exactly whether it’s safe to publish and what to fix first.
