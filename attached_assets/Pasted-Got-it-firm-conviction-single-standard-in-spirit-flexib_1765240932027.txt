Got it — firm conviction, single standard in spirit, flexible in application, no “you can / you can’t” tiers.
Here’s a cleaner, unified version that protects the heart of what you’re after:

---

### **Sobriety & Witness**

**Living with clarity, self-control, and a Spirit-led mind.**

> *“Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit.”*
> — *Ephesians 5:18*

We believe followers of Jesus are called to practice sobriety — not just as a behavior, but as a posture of the heart. Sobriety reflects a life that is alert, disciplined, and yielded to the Holy Spirit rather than influenced or impaired by any substance, activity, or habit.

Scripture calls believers to avoid drunkenness, addiction, and anything that diminishes judgment, weakens witness, or causes another person to stumble (Romans 14:21; 1 Corinthians 8:9; 1 Peter 5:8). Our goal is to live in a way that reflects wisdom, responsibility, and love for others.

### **Leadership Example**

Those who serve or represent the ministry of Garden City Church agree to maintain a sober and clear mind while serving, leading, on church property, or participating in ministry-related activities.

This standard is rooted in responsibility, influence, and example — recognizing that leadership is both seen and followed.

We believe the way we live communicates as loudly as the gospel we preach. Therefore, we ask all who serve to exercise discernment, self-control, and intentionality in their personal choices — especially in areas involving alcohol, drugs, or other mind-altering substances.

### **Commitment**

**I commit to living sober-minded and exercising wisdom, self-control, and responsibility in my personal conduct. I agree to honor Garden City Church’s expectations for sobriety and clarity while serving, representing the church, or participating in ministry environments.**

Short, unified, conviction-driven — but it leaves breathing room where appropriate.
