MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 2.1
ENFORCE 8–12 LESSON MINIMUM + ANALYSIS SOURCE REPORT
STOP AFTER REPORT

You completed Phase 2 but did NOT meet the minimum lessons requirement. This is a correction pass that is STILL PART OF PHASE 2.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT start Phase 3 (dashboard redesign).
- Do NOT redesign onboarding.
- Do NOT modify navigation outside training flow.
- Do NOT touch rooms/calendar/meetings/planning center.
- Only adjust training module lesson structures, reporting, and verification.
- STOP after returning the required report.

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT
For each CORE training module, you MUST have >= 8 lessons (target 8–12).
Core manuals/trainings include (title match best intent):
- About Us
- Discipleship Pathway / Journey
- SERVE Orientation / Serve Booklet
- Live the Life
- Tell the Story
- Following Jesus (if part of core track)
- Language of a Leader
- Recruitment 101
- Ministry Leaders Manual (or equivalent)

Additionally, any training assigned to audience = “all” OR “leader” must also be >= 8 lessons (target 8–12).

TASKS
1) Identify all training modules with lessonCount < 8.
   - Produce an internal list grouped by audience (core/all/leader/ministry).

2) For each module with < 8 lessons:
   - Expand to at least 8 lessons by splitting content into logical lesson topics based on manual sections/headings.
   - Do NOT add filler. Each lesson must teach a distinct concept.
   - Each lesson must maintain structure:
     - Teaching
     - Why This Matters
     - Reflection prompt

3) Preserve existing question banks where possible, but if lesson splits require alignment:
   - Add or redistribute knowledge-check questions so they map to lesson topics.
   - Keep intensive assessment at the end (scenario-based) intact.

4) Add a required “analysis source completeness” report:
   - List all manuals missing DOCX/MD/TXT analysis files.
   - Mark which trainings were generated from PDF fallback.
   - Do NOT regenerate everything—just report and flag.

5) Run basic end-to-end training flow tests (smoke tests):
   - Start training → complete lessons → knowledge checks → pass assessment → mark complete
   - Reopen completed training in revisit mode → review content → retake quiz (if allowed)
   - Verify progress bar updates correctly for expanded lessons

PHASE 2.1 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)
1) LESSON FLOOR FIX SUMMARY
- count of trainings that were <8 and are now >=8
- list each affected training with before/after lesson count

2) CORE TRAININGS COMPLIANCE TABLE
For each core training:
- lesson count (must be >=8)
- knowledge check present? (yes/no)
- intensive assessment present? (yes/no)
- revisit works? (yes/no)

3) ALL/LEADER TRAININGS COMPLIANCE
- list any “all” or “leader” trainings still <8 (should be none)
- if any remain, explain why (only acceptable if you fix them)

4) ANALYSIS SOURCE COMPLETENESS REPORT
- manuals missing DOCX/MD/TXT
- trainings generated from PDF fallback

5) SMOKE TEST RESULTS
- pass/fail for completion flow
- pass/fail for revisit flow

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 2.1 complete. Phase 2 requirements now satisfied. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 3.”

STOP.
