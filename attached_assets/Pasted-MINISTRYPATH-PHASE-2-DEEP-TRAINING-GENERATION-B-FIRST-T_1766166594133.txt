MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 2
DEEP TRAINING GENERATION (B FIRST, THEN A)
STOP AFTER PHASE 2 REPORT

You have completed Phase 1. Proceed to Phase 2 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Do NOT redesign onboarding yet.
- Do NOT redesign dashboards yet.
- Do NOT change navigation yet.
- Do NOT touch Rooms/Calendar/Meetings/Planning Center yet.
- Do NOT refactor roles system-wide yet.
- Phase 2 is ONLY: generate and verify DEEP training modules from manuals, with correct assignment rules.
- STOP after Phase 2 and output the report sections listed at the bottom.

GOAL
Transform manuals into robust, reviewable training modules with:
1) Teaching series (8–12 lessons minimum)
2) Knowledge check (light)
3) Intensive assessment (scenario + application)
4) Reflection (stored and visible to leaders/admins)
Users MUST be able to revisit completed trainings (content + results + reflection) at any time.

DEFINITIONS
Manual categories (already implemented):
- ministry_manual (default training = ON)
- leadership_training (default training = ON)
- resource (default training = OFF unless explicitly enabled)

Training must always store:
- sourceManualId
- category
- audience requirements (Member/Leader/Pastor + optional tags later)
- whether required or optional
- publish/unpublish

QUALITY STANDARD (VERY IMPORTANT)
A “training module” is INVALID if:
- it contains only a summary and a few questions
- it has fewer than 8 lessons
- it lacks a scenario-based assessment
- it cannot be revisited after completion
- it does not store results clearly

PHASE 2 EXECUTION ORDER (B → then A)

STEP 1 — Select “Core Manuals” (B)
Identify and generate deep training modules for these CORE manuals first (use title matching):
- About Us
- Discipleship Pathway (or any equivalent “Discipleship Path / Journey” manual)
- SERVE Orientation (or “Serve Booklet” equivalent)
- Live the Life, Tell the Story (if separate manuals exist, treat each as core)
- Following Jesus (if present as a resource/training manual)
Additionally, include these core leadership manuals if present:
- Language of a Leader
- Recruitment 101
- Ministry Leaders Manual (or equivalent)

If exact titles differ, match by closest intent and list what you selected.

STEP 2 — Generate deep training for Core Manuals ONLY
For each selected core manual:
A) Create 8–12 lesson segments minimum
   - Each segment must include:
     - Title
     - Teaching content (clear paragraphs; not bullet-only)
     - “Why this matters in serving / church culture”
     - A short reflection prompt
     - Scripture references where appropriate (do not invent verses; reference only if present in manual or clearly required by the topic)

B) Knowledge Check
   - 8–15 questions
   - Mix: multiple choice + short answer
   - Provide correct answers and explanations

C) Intensive Assessment (REQUIRED)
   - 10–20 questions
   - Must include:
     - scenario-based questions (real ministry situations)
     - application-based questions (“what would you do?”)
   - Must include answer key + explanations
   - Passing score configurable (default 70%)

D) Reflection
   - Required final reflection submission
   - Stored permanently to userTrainingProgress record (or linked table)
   - Visible to assigned leader/admin/pastor

E) Revisit Support
   - Ensure TrainingViewer supports:
     - reopening completed training
     - viewing lesson content
     - viewing past answers/scores
     - viewing reflection responses
   - If this is missing, implement it now (Phase 2 is allowed to add this because it is core to training quality).

F) Assignment Rules (Core)
   - About Us / Discipleship Pathway / SERVE Orientation / Live the Life / Tell the Story:
     - required for Dream Team Members, Leaders, Pastors (all experiences)
   - Leadership manuals (Language of a Leader, Recruitment 101, Ministry Leaders Manual):
     - required for Leaders and Pastors by default (not members)

Publish state:
- Core trainings should be “published” so they can be taken.

STEP 3 — Quality Gate Report (Core Manuals)
After generating core trainings, you MUST produce an internal quality check:
- Confirm each core training has 8–12 lessons
- Confirm each has knowledge check + intensive assessment + reflection
- Confirm revisit works
- Confirm assignments match rules

If any fail, fix them before proceeding.

STEP 4 — Proceed to remaining manuals (A)
Now generate training modules for the remaining manuals using category defaults:
- ministry_manual: generate training ON (required for that ministry)
- leadership_training: generate training ON (required for leaders/pastors unless specified)
- resource: generate training OFF by default
   - BUT: if the resource manual is clearly onboarding/culture/policy critical, enable training ON and mark it required for all or for leaders (use best judgment and list which you enabled)

STEP 5 — Ministry-specific assignment rules
For each ministry_manual:
- Link training to the correct ministryId
- Visibility restricted to users assigned to that ministry
- Required for onboarding into that ministry

STEP 6 — Ensure manual→training sync
After all trainings generated:
- trainingModules.manualId must be set for all generated modules
- manualAnalysis must correspond to the analysis source (prefer DOCX/MD/TXT over PDF)
- if analysis source missing, still generate but flag as “needsAnalysisSource” in report

STOP CONDITIONS
At the end of Phase 2, DO NOT proceed to Phase 3 (dashboard redesign) or Phase 4 (onboarding redesign).

PHASE 2 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)
1) CORE MANUALS SELECTED (B)
- list titles matched
- category for each
- audience requirement for each

2) CORE TRAININGS GENERATED (B) — QUALITY TABLE
For each core training:
- # lessons (must be >= 8)
- knowledge check question count
- intensive assessment question count
- reflection required? (yes/no)
- revisit supported? (yes/no)

3) REMAINING TRAININGS GENERATED (A)
- total count generated
- count by category (ministry_manual / leadership_training / resource)
- list any resources where training was enabled and why

4) MISSING ANALYSIS SOURCES
- manuals missing DOCX/MD/TXT and what’s needed

5) ASSIGNMENT SUMMARY
- what trainings are required for Members (all)
- what trainings are required for Leaders/Pastors
- what trainings are ministry-specific

6) ANY FILES/COMPONENTS UPDATED FOR TRAINING REVIEWABILITY
- list key files changed (viewer, progress, schema)

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 2 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 3.”

DO NOT ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END. STOP.
