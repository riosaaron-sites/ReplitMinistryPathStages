Here’s a clean, dev-ready prompt you can drop straight into your app/orations instructions:

**Email Automation on Assessment Completion**

Upon **full completion** of the spiritual gifts assessment:

1. **Trigger Automatic Emails**
   Automatically send the assessment results to:

   * Subject line example:
     **“[Participant Name] – Spiritual Gifts Assessment Results”**

   * Clearly display in the body of the email:
