MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 8
LAUNCH POLISH: HELP CENTER + USER RESET TOOL + FOOTER COPYRIGHT + VIDEO-READY TRAININGS
STOP AFTER PHASE 8 REPORT

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign onboarding again.
- Do NOT redesign dashboards beyond small polish and help entry points.
- Do NOT remove existing manuals/trainings/systems.
- Implement Help Center using content derived from existing manuals + current features.
- User reset MUST protect the owner/admin account by email.
- STOP after Phase 8 and return the required output.

GOALS
1) Add a real documentation/help experience (like a lightweight Planning Center help center)
2) Ensure all uploaded manuals are discoverable and categorized in-app (not “hidden behind admin”)
3) Add a safe tool to reset all users except the owner/admin
4) Update footer copyright text to “Aaron Rios” while keeping GCC presence
5) Prepare trainings to support video embeds (URL-based)

---

## A) HELP CENTER (MANDATORY)

Create /help (and link it visibly from:
- Landing page
- Member dashboard
- Leadership dashboard
- Admin panel)

Help center must include:
1) Search bar
2) Categories (at minimum):
- Getting Started (Onboarding, Profile, Ministries)
- Trainings (Required/Optional/Completed, Review mode)
- Discipleship Journey (Worship → Next Night → Learn → Love → Lead)
- Workboard & Meetings (boards, action items, meeting mode)
- Serving Metrics & Health (what indicators mean)
- Surveys & Biblical Formation (what it is, how to grow)
- Admin & Config (manuals, generating trainings, labels, roles)

Each category contains articles with:
- title
- short summary
- readable body
- “Related links” to relevant app pages

Articles can be seeded from:
- your existing manuals’ AI summaries
- existing UI feature descriptions

Also add:
- A “Contact / Ask for Help” article pointing to your internal request flow if present.

---

## B) MANUALS DISCOVERABILITY (MANDATORY)

Add a “Resources Library” page /resources that:
- lists manuals by the 3 categories:
  1) Ministry Manuals
  2) Leadership Training
  3) Resources
- shows title, description, and who it applies to
- allows members to view manuals they have access to
- allows leaders/admins to view all

Ensure this is consistent with training module linkage.

---

## C) SAFE USER RESET TOOL (MANDATORY)

Create an admin-only tool:
- “Reset Database Users (Except Owner)” with DRY RUN by default

Rules:
- Protected account email: pastor@gardencitychurch.net
- DRY RUN shows counts of users + dependent records that would be removed/archived
- EXECUTE requires explicit confirmation (typed phrase) and/or --execute flag
- Removes/archives:
  - users (except protected)
  - training progress
  - survey results
  - messages
  - boards/action items
  - requests/join requests
  - meetings/notes participation
Keep schema intact.

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT log or display any credentials.
- Do NOT implement plaintext password handling.

---

## D) FOOTER COPYRIGHT UPDATE (MANDATORY)

Update footer across app to:
“© Aaron Rios — Garden City Church”
Keep Garden City Church branding throughout.

---

## E) VIDEO-READY TRAININGS (MANDATORY FOUNDATION)

In training module admin editor:
- add optional fields:
  - videoUrl (embed)
  - videoTitle (optional)
- In TrainingViewer:
  - if videoUrl exists, render embedded video above the lesson content
- No file uploads required in this phase.

---

PHASE 8 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)

1) HELP CENTER SUMMARY
- routes added
- categories list
- how articles are stored (db/seed/static)

2) RESOURCES LIBRARY
- access rules
- category grouping

3) USER RESET TOOL
- dry run output example
- how execute is protected
- confirmation that protected admin email is excluded

4) FOOTER CHANGE CONFIRMATION
- exact footer text

5) VIDEO SUPPORT CONFIRMATION
- where admin sets video URL
- where user sees it

End with:
“Phase 8 complete. System is launch-polished and documented.”

STOP.
