SYSTEM: Modify the existing MinistryPath app. Do NOT rebuild. Correct onboarding flow, ministry selection logic, dashboard behavior, training requirements, and required-classes interaction. Remove redundancy, prevent freezes, and enforce consistency.

GOAL: Ensure onboarding runs once, ministry selection is accurate and persistent, dashboard is clean and role-aware, and trainings reflect only what is truly required.

====================================================
1) WELCOME TO THE DREAM TEAM — MINISTRY SELECTION FIX
====================================================

Issue:
The “Choose Your Ministry” list is currently incorrect.

Fix:
- Display ALL ministries listed under “Ministry Roles” (Profile Settings).
- Do NOT display a partial or filtered list unless intentionally role-restricted.
- Allow selection of one or more ministries as appropriate to role.

Persistence:
- Whatever ministries are selected here MUST:
  - remain checked later under Profile Settings
  - remain consistent across:
    - Profile
    - Edit Profile
    - Dashboard
    - Trainings
    - Discipleship Journey

Dashboard Personalization:
- Dashboard greeting should reflect role + selected ministry/ministry names.
  Example:
  “Welcome John Doe — Dream Team Member | Kingdom Children”

====================================================
2) REQUIRED CLASSES — INTERACTIVE STATUS FLOW
====================================================

Issue:
“Required Classes” warning is passive and unclear.

Fix:
- The “Update Status” action must route the user to:
  → My Journey (Discipleship view)
- From there, the user can mark:
  - Next Night
  - Following Jesus

Enhanced Interaction (Required):
When selecting status, require user input — not simple toggles.

Next Night:
- Ask:
  - Date attended
  - (Optional) Location
- Confirmation via original affirmation statement

Following Jesus:
- Options:
  - Completed
  - Scheduled / Intend to take
- If completed:
  - Ask date attended
- If scheduled/intended:
  - Keep status as PENDING until completed
- Confirmation via original affirmation statement

Sunday Service Context:
- Do NOT treat Sunday worship as Next Night.
- Ask clarifying questions:
  - Do you consistently attend Sunday mornings?
  - Do you attend Discipleship Hour / Sunday School?

Admin Tracking:
- All answers and dates must be visible to admins.
- Persistent warning remains until both classes are COMPLETE.

====================================================
3) ONBOARDING FREEZE & REPEAT STEPS — FIX
====================================================

Issue:
After selecting Next Night / Following Jesus and clicking “Complete Onboarding”:
- App freezes
- Requires multiple clicks
- Repeats profile setup

Fix:
- “Complete Onboarding” must be:
  - single-action
  - idempotent (cannot run twice)
- Once onboarding is complete:
  - NEVER route back to profile setup
  - NEVER re-ask bio, links, phone, social fields
  - NEVER re-trigger profile photo unless missing

====================================================
4) PROFILE PHOTO FLOW — CORRECTION
====================================================

Rules:
- Profile photo upload is requested ONLY IF no photo exists.
- Successful upload:
  - must not show error
  - must persist immediately
- Failed upload:
  - show clear error only when request actually fails

Profile completion (bio, links, phone, socials):
- Asked ONCE during initial setup
- Editing only allowed later via “Edit Profile”

====================================================
5) DISCIPLESHIP JOURNEY — NEXT STEPS LOGIC
====================================================

Welcome / Discipleship Page:
After “What’s Left / Next Steps to Complete”:
- Display ONLY:
  - ministry-specific training for the ministry selected at onboarding

Dashboard:
- “What’s Left / Next Steps” should ONLY appear if:
  - account is incomplete (profile photo missing, bio missing, etc.)
- Once account is complete:
  - remove “What’s Left” from Dashboard

Next Steps Content:
- Show ONLY ministry-specific training
- When a step is marked complete:
  - remove it from “Next Steps”
  - reflect progress in Discipleship Path below
- Discipleship Path area becomes the historical + editable overview

====================================================
6) DASHBOARD — SIMPLIFICATION
====================================================

Dashboard should ONLY display:
- Welcome message (role + ministry)
- Required Classes warning (if applicable)
- About Us
- Ask for Help
- My Roles

Remove:
- Redundant training cards
- Duplicate surveys
- Any content already accessible elsewhere

====================================================
