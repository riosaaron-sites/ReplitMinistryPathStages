🔒 MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 1 PROMPT

FOUNDATION ONLY · MANUAL RESET & REGISTRATION · STOP AFTER REPORT

You have completed Phase 0 (Audit).
You are now authorized to proceed with PHASE 1 ONLY.

⚠️ ABSOLUTE EXECUTION RULE
You MUST STOP after completing Phase 1 and returning the required report.
You must NOT proceed to Phase 2 or beyond unless explicitly authorized.

🚫 DO NOT DO THESE YET

Do NOT redesign onboarding

Do NOT redesign dashboards

Do NOT generate deep training modules yet

Do NOT modify survey logic

Do NOT implement room/calendar/meeting redesigns

Do NOT refactor roles globally yet

Phase 1 is foundation only.

🎯 PHASE 1 GOALS (IN PLAIN ENGLISH)

Phase 1 exists to:

Remove old manuals safely

Register ONLY the new uploaded manuals

Categorize them correctly

Reconnect manuals ↔ ministries ↔ training modules

Prepare the system for deep training generation later

Nothing more.

📚 MANUAL CATEGORIES (ONLY THESE THREE)

You must enforce a strict enum with only these categories:

1️⃣ Ministry Manuals

Title = ministry name

Linked to a specific ministry

Visible ONLY to people serving in that ministry

Default: generate training module = ON

2️⃣ Leadership Training

Language of a Leader

Recruitment 101

Ministry Leaders Manual

Job descriptions

Default: generate training module = ON

Typically required for leaders/pastors (assignment comes later)

3️⃣ Resources

About Us

Policies

Bylaws

General information

SERVE booklet

Default: generate training module = OFF (admin may enable later)

⚠️ Ignore any upload-time wording like “leadership”, “ministry”, or “resources”.
Final categorization happens here.

🧾 TWO-FORMAT MANUAL SUPPORT (FOUNDATION)

Update the system so each manual supports:

PDF file (view/download)

Analysis source file (DOCX / MD / TXT)

If a manual only has a PDF:

Register it

Mark analysis source as missing

Report it clearly

Do NOT generate training content yet.

🧹 PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
1️⃣ Add / Enforce Manual Category Enum

ministry_manual

leadership_training

resource

Remove or normalize any legacy category values.

2️⃣ Create Admin “Reset Manuals” Tool

Admin-only operation with TWO MODES:

A) DRY RUN

Show how many manuals WILL be deleted

Show how many analyses WILL be deleted

Show how many training links WILL be affected

NO deletion occurs

B) EXECUTE

Delete ALL existing manuals from the database

Delete all manual analyses

Remove orphaned training module references

Uploaded files remain untouched

Add confirmation protection so this cannot be triggered accidentally.

3️⃣ Register Uploaded Manuals

Scan uploaded files

Create records in the manuals table with:

title (from filename)

category (one of the three above)

linked ministry (if ministry manual)

required flag (based on category)

PDF path

analysis source path (if present)

Report:

manuals registered

manuals missing analysis source

manuals that could not be categorized or linked

4️⃣ Fix Training ↔ Manual Linking

Ensure trainingModules.manualId always points to a valid manual

Identify training modules with:

manualId = null

or invalid manual reference

Mark them as needsManualLink

Do NOT generate new training content yet

5️⃣ Create “Field Bank / Config Bank” (FOUNDATION ONLY)

Admin-managed lists for:

Tags (admin, owner, pastor, associate, intern, etc.)

Serve Roles (usher, greeter, AV, worship, kids, etc.)

Titles (children’s pastor, youth pastor, etc.)

Only schema + basic admin UI.
Do NOT wire throughout the app yet.

6️⃣ Delete Truly Obsolete Manual-Related Code

Only if:

It is unused after these changes

It relates ONLY to old manual handling

Be conservative.

📤 REQUIRED PHASE 1 OUTPUT (STOP AFTER THIS)

Return ONLY the following sections:

1️⃣ WHAT CHANGED

Files touched

Schema/DB changes

2️⃣ RESET MANUALS TOOL STATUS

DRY RUN exists? (yes/no)

EXECUTE exists? (yes/no)

What will be deleted in DRY RUN

3️⃣ MANUAL REGISTRATION RESULTS

Total manuals registered

Count per category

Manuals missing analysis source

Manuals not linked to ministries (if any)

4️⃣ TRAINING LINK STATUS

Training modules correctly linked

Training modules still unlinked + why

5️⃣ NEXT RECOMMENDED STEP

Proposal for Phase 2 (Deep Training Generation)

⛔ STOP CONDITION (MANDATORY)

End your response with this exact sentence:

“Phase 1 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 2.”

You must STOP after this.

✅ END OF PHASE 1 PROMPT
