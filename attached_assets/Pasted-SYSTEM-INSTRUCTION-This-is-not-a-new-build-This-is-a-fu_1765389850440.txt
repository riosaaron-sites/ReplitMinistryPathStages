SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
This is not a new build. This is a full integration, upgrade, and continuation of the existing MinistryPath app already being developed. Do NOT delete or replace existing code, structure, modules, or user data.
Instead, expand, refine, integrate, and connect all features below into the current app structure, resolving redundancy by merging content intelligently.

The final product must be:
Simple. Intuitive. Zero learning curve. Clean. Beautiful. Lightweight. Logical. Ministry-ready.

All screens must clearly present next steps with obvious navigation. Every user must always think:

“I know exactly what to do next.”

🔥 PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE APP

MinistryPath is a church engagement and operations hub designed for Garden City Church.
It helps users onboard into the church, discover where they fit, complete ministry training, schedule availability, and communicate with ministry leaders — all while following our discipleship model:

Worship → NEXT → Learn → Love → Lead

Users are part of the GCC Dream Team and receive ministry-specific and universal training based on roles and permissions.
