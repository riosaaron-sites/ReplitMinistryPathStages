🔒 MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 0 MASTER PROMPT

AUDIT ONLY · STOP AFTER REPORT · NO CODE CHANGES

You are working inside an existing, running codebase called MinistryPath.

⚠️ IMPORTANT EXECUTION RULE
You are instructed to perform PHASE 0 ONLY.
You must STOP after producing the audit output described below.
You must NOT modify any code.
You must NOT delete anything.
You must NOT generate training modules.
You must NOT register manuals.
You must NOT proceed to later phases unless explicitly instructed.

CONTEXT (DO NOT CHANGE)

The site currently runs in Replit.

All new manuals have already been uploaded as files.

Old manuals are still present in the database.

A full overhaul is planned, but NOT YET.

Your task right now is to understand the system, not change it.

YOUR TASK — PHASE 0 (AUDIT ONLY)
1️⃣ REVIEW THE ENTIRE CODEBASE

You must examine:

frontend pages and routes

backend routes and services

database schema

onboarding flow

dashboard logic

manuals + training logic

admin vs user permissions

ministry, role, tag structures

navigation and menus

Do not assume intent — verify in code.

2️⃣ IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT THE FOLLOWING
A. WHAT EXISTS

Provide a clear list of:

onboarding-related screens

dashboard-related screens

manuals handling

training handling

ministry structures

admin functionality

user roles/tags

survey logic

meetings / calendar / room features (if any exist)

B. DISCONNECTS & PROBLEMS

List clearly:

dead-end pages

redundant routes

duplicate concepts (same thing in multiple places)

“glitter” features (look complete but don’t function)

places where manuals and trainings are not connected

places where completion status does not allow review

confusing navigation

unnecessary or obsolete code

C. DATA & STRUCTURE ISSUES

Identify:

where manuals are stored

how trainings reference manuals (or don’t)

whether manual categories currently exist

whether training generation is shallow or incomplete

how roles, tags, ministries, and permissions are handled

what would block the planned overhaul if not fixed

3️⃣ PREPARE FOR FUTURE PHASES (NO EXECUTION YET)

Without implementing anything, propose:

A phased refactor plan (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3…)

Where old manuals will be deleted safely

Where new manuals will be registered and categorized

Where deep training modules will be generated

Where onboarding will be redesigned

Where obsolete code can be safely removed

Which files/components are likely to be deleted or consolidated

⚠️ This is planning only, not execution.

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (DO NOT DEVIATE)

You must return ONLY the following sections:

1. AUDIT REPORT

Clear bullet list of what exists and how it works today

2. DISCONNECT & REDUNDANCY LIST

Clear list of problems and confusing areas

3. REFACTOR ROADMAP (PROPOSED)

Phased, high-level plan

No code yet

4. CONFIRMATION STATEMENT

End your response with this exact sentence:

“Phase 0 complete. No code has been modified. Awaiting authorization to proceed.”

FINAL RULE

If you attempt to:

delete manuals

modify code

refactor files

generate trainings

redesign onboarding

continue past Phase 0

…you are violating instructions.

STOP AFTER THE AUDIT.
