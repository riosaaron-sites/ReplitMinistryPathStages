You are working in the existing MinistryPath codebase.

GOAL:
Replace XP (experience points) with a pastoral, non-gamified progress system called “Milestones” or “Path Progress,” WITHOUT rewriting core logic or data models.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT add a new points or scoring system.
- Do NOT rebuild training, onboarding, or notification flows.
- Reuse existing events, audit logs, and state transitions.
- This is a language + presentation + light-mapping change.

==================================================
PART A — CONCEPTUAL REPURPOSING (NO DB REWRITE)
==================================================
1) Treat any existing XP-related logic as an internal progress trigger, not a score.
2) Stop surfacing XP values to users entirely.
3) Introduce a conceptual layer:
   - “Milestone”
   - “Progress Step”
   - “Readiness Marker”
   (Choose one term and use it consistently; prefer “Milestone” or “Path Progress.”)

==================================================
PART B — USER-FACING LANGUAGE CHANGES
==================================================
Replace XP language in:
- Notifications
- Emails
- UI messages
- CoachBubbles
- Toasts / alerts

Examples:
- “+XP” → “Milestone Reached”
- “You gained XP” → “You’ve taken a meaningful step forward”
- “Level up” → REMOVE entirely
- “Progress increased” → “You’re moving forward on your path”

Ensure tone is:
- encouraging
- pastoral
- affirmational
- not competitive

==================================================
PART C — MILESTONE DEFINITIONS (DERIVED, NOT STORED)
==================================================
Define milestones based on existing system states:

- Onboarding Started
- Profile Completed
- Team Joined
- Training Submitted
- Training Affirmed by Leader
- Ready to Serve (derived when required trainings are affirmed)

Do NOT store these as a new table.
Derive them from existing data and states.

==================================================
PART D — UI PRESENTATION (MINIMAL)
==================================================
1) Where XP was previously shown (if anywhere):
   - Replace with a simple progress indicator:
     - “You’re progressing”
     - “Next milestone: [X]”
2) Optional (only if trivial):
   - Simple checklist-style display on “My Path” page
   - No percentages, no levels, no scores

==================================================
PART E — ADMIN & LEADER VIEW
==================================================
1) Leaders and admins should see:
   - current status per member
   - milestones reached (derived)
2) Admin override actions should log:
   - “Milestone affirmed via admin override”
   in audit logs (language only; reuse existing logs)

==================================================
PART F — CLEANUP
==================================================
1) Remove XP references from:
   - user notifications
   - emails
   - CoachBubbles
2) Keep underlying numeric fields untouched if they exist, but unused.
3) Verify no XP wording appears in the UI.

==================================================
FINAL OUTPUT
==================================================
- List files updated
- Confirm no DB schema changes
- Provide a short test checklist:
  - Training approval triggers milestone messaging
  - No XP visible anywhere
  - My Path reflects forward movement without points

STOP after completion.
