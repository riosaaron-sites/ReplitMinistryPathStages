MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 3
REMOVE “COMING SOON” + BUILD BEAUTIFUL LOGIN + COMPLETE ADMIN BACKEND FOR MANUALS/TRAININGS
STOP AFTER PHASE 3 REPORT

You have completed Phase 2.1 successfully. Proceed to Phase 3 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign the entire member dashboard yet (Phase 4).
- Do NOT redesign onboarding yet (Phase 5).
- Do NOT change Rooms/Calendar/Meetings/Planning Center in this phase.
- Do NOT refactor global roles system in this phase.
- Phase 3 focus is ONLY:
  1) Remove Coming Soon splash gate
  2) Replace it with a beautiful public login screen (marketing + login)
  3) Make the Admin backend a complete control center for manuals & trainings so the owner/admin can manage without Replit AI
  4) Fix any admin access + mobile leadership link issues necessary for these goals
- STOP after Phase 3 and provide the required report.

PART 1 — REMOVE “COMING SOON”
1) Remove the Coming Soon maintenance gate:
   - eliminate SHOW_COMING_SOON = true behavior
   - remove or retire the ComingSoon page/route if present
2) Ensure unauthenticated users land on the new Login/Landing page.
3) Ensure authenticated users route appropriately (member vs leadership experience) without broken loops.

PART 2 — BEAUTIFUL LOGIN / PUBLIC LANDING PAGE
Create a modern, clean landing+login screen that:
- Is the new public entry route when not logged in
- Explains MinistryPath in simple language (onboarding, training, discipleship, serving)
- Shows 4–6 feature cards:
  - Onboarding & Training
  - Manuals → Deep Trainings
  - Progress & “What’s Next”
  - Communication / Meetings
  - Rooms / Calendar Planning (if enabled)
- Has a clear Log In action
- Works perfectly on mobile
- Uses Montserrat and this palette:
  #f2660f highlights
  #223134 borders/boxes
  #424242 secondary text
  black/white primary
- Remove clutter; keep it easy for teens and seniors.

PART 3 — ADMIN BACKEND: MAKE IT A REAL CONTROL CENTER
Goal: Owner/Admin can manage manuals and trainings without Replit AI.

Implement/upgrade Admin Backend capabilities:

A) Manual Management (required)
Admin can:
- Add manual with TWO formats:
  - PDF attachment (view/download)
  - analysis source file (DOCX/MD/TXT)
- Set manual category (ministry_manual / leadership_training / resource)
- Set required/optional
- Link to ministry (required when category=ministry_manual)
- Replace files (update PDF and/or analysis source)
- Edit title/description
- Delete manual safely (confirmation + show what will be affected)
- Regenerate training from manual on demand (deep pipeline)
- View manual status:
  - analysis source missing? (yes/no)
  - training generated? (yes/no)
  - lesson count
  - assessment count
  - published status

B) Training Management (required)
Admin can:
- Publish/unpublish
- Required/optional
- Assign audience:
  - Member / Leader / Pastor
  - plus tag-based targeting from Field Bank tags
- Re-run deep generation pipeline
- View training structure summary:
  - lesson count
  - knowledge check count
  - intensive assessment count
  - reflection enabled (yes/no)
- View completion stats:
  - # completed
  - # in progress
  - pass/fail counts (basic)

C) Field Bank / Config Bank (required)
Provide admin UI to manage:
- Tags (admin/owner/pastor/associate/intern/custom)
- Serve roles (usher/greeter/AV/worship/kids/etc.)
- Staff titles (children’s pastor/youth pastor/etc.)
- Global labels (rename “Dream Team”, etc.)
These lists must be stored and used consistently where they appear.

PART 4 — ACCESS & MOBILE FIXES (only what’s necessary)
1) Non-admin users must be blocked from admin routes.
2) Admin access method must be clear:
   - allow /admin/login or role-gated /admin entry
3) Fix leadership portal link hidden on mobile:
   - remove `hidden sm:flex` issue
   - ensure leadership access is available from a mobile-friendly menu (e.g., user dropdown)

PHASE 3 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)
1) COMING SOON REMOVAL
- what was removed/changed
- where users now land when not logged in

2) LOGIN PAGE SUMMARY
- route used
- key UI sections
- mobile behavior confirmation

3) ADMIN BACKEND CAPABILITIES CHECKLIST
Manuals: add / edit / delete / replace / categorize / required / link to ministry / regenerate training (yes/no each)
Trainings: publish / required / audience assignment / tag targeting / regenerate / view structure summary / view completion stats (yes/no each)
Field Bank: tags / serve roles / staff titles / global labels (yes/no each)

4) SECURITY CONFIRMATION

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 3 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 4.”

STOP.
