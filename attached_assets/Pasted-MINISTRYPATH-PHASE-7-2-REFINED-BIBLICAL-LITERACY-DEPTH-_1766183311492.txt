MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 7.2 (REFINED)
BIBLICAL LITERACY DEPTH + DISCIPLESHIP INTEGRATION
STOP AFTER PHASE 7.2 REPORT

This phase EXTENDS Phase 7.1. Do NOT undo or redesign existing features.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign onboarding or dashboards.
- Do NOT introduce new major UI sections.
- Do NOT change role permissions.
- Biblical Literacy must integrate into EXISTING health, encouragement, and oversight systems.
- STOP after Phase 7.2 and return the required output.

GOAL
Make Biblical Literacy:
- meaningful
- pastoral
- actionable
- visible to leaders
- encouraging to members

---

## A) BIBLICAL LITERACY QUESTION ENHANCEMENT (MANDATORY)

1) Expand Biblical Literacy to ~18–24 questions.
2) Organize into 4 buckets:
   - Bible Basics
   - Story & Timeline
   - Jesus & Salvation
   - How to Read the Bible (context, genre, application)
3) Difficulty mix:
   - 40% easy
   - 40% medium
   - 20% challenge (fair, not obscure)

---

## B) SCORING & LEVELS (MANDATORY)

Define literacy levels:
- Low
- Developing
- Strong

Store:
- overall literacy level
- per-bucket scores

These scores must:
- contribute to the existing health indicator logic
- never be displayed as “fail/pass”

---

## C) MEMBER EXPERIENCE (MANDATORY)

1) Survey Results Page:
- Show:
  - Biblical Literacy level
  - brief explanation (pastoral tone)
  - 2–4 recommended next steps based on level

2) Dashboard Integration:
- Include Biblical Literacy as part of:
  - Growth Snapshot
  - or Health Indicator explanation tooltip
- No new dashboard sections required

Example next steps by level:
- Low → Bible Basics, Discipleship Hour, Following Jesus
- Developing → 365 Bible Plan, small study habits
- Strong → Leadership track reading, mentoring, facilitating

---

## D) LEADER / PASTOR VISIBILITY (MANDATORY)

1) In People views:
- Leaders see Biblical Literacy level for people in their ministries
- Pastors/Admins see it for all users

2) Display:
- overall level
- bucket breakdown
- suggested discipleship focus

3) Literacy results should:
- inform encouragement notes
- inform “Needs Care / Growing” health states
- be reviewable historically

---

## E) TONE & SAFETY

- No academic language
- No shame-based phrasing
- Literacy is framed as “formation,” not intelligence

---

PHASE 7.2 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)

1) QUESTION STRUCTURE
- total questions
- bucket breakdown

2) SCORING & HEALTH INTEGRATION
- how literacy affects health indicators

3) MEMBER EXPERIENCE
- where literacy appears
- example encouragement language

4) LEADER/PASTOR EXPERIENCE
- where results are visible
- how they inform care

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 7.2 complete. Biblical Literacy is now integrated into discipleship care.”

STOP.
