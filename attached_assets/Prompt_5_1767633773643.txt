You are working in the existing MinistryPath codebase.

GOAL:
Add a system-wide "Invite" button for leaders/pastors that supports inviting multiple people at once, WITHOUT creating a separate invite subsystem. Reuse the existing Team Invites system (/api/team-invites, TeamInvite storage, InviteAccept route, email sending).

NON-NEGOTIABLES:
- Do NOT create a new independent invite table or token system.
- Do NOT hard-code ministry lists.
- Leaders can only invite into ministries they oversee. Admin/pastor can invite into any ministry.
- Keep UI simple: one modal, one text area for bulk input, minimal clicks.
- Every invite created must appear in the existing InviteManagement list and use the same acceptance URL (/invite/:token).

WHAT EXISTS (reuse it):
- InviteManagement already posts to POST /api/team-invites with fields like firstName/lastName/email/ministryIds/roleType/message.
- There is a public invite accept route at /invite/:token.
- Storage layer already supports createTeamInvite and getTeamInvites.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (IN ORDER):

1) Add a global "Invite" button for leaders/pastors:
- Place it in LeadershipLayout header (and optionally MemberLayout header ONLY if user has leadership access).
- Button label: "Invite"
- Clicking opens a modal: InviteModal

2) Build InviteModal with two modes (tabs):
A) Single Invite (reuse existing form fields)
B) Bulk Invite (new)
Keep the single invite fields consistent with InviteManagement.

3) Bulk Invite UI (simple):
- Textarea labeled: "Paste one person per line"
- Supported formats per line:
  - "John Doe <john@example.com>"
  - "john@example.com"
  - "John Doe, john@example.com"
- Optional dropdown/checkboxes:
  - Ministry selection (default preselected to leader’s ministry/ministries; admin can pick any)
  - roleType default "member" (allow selecting "leader" if admin/pastor)
  - optional message (applied to all invites)

4) Backend: Bulk endpoint reusing same create logic
- Add POST /api/team-invites/bulk
- Payload:
  {
    invites: [{ firstName?, lastName?, email, ministryIds?, roleType?, roleName?, message? }, ...]
  }
- Validate each invite the same way single invite does.
- For leaders (non-admin): enforce ministryIds ⊆ leader’s overseen ministries.
- Create invites in a transaction when possible. If transaction not supported, create sequentially but return per-invite results.
- Response should return:
  { created: [...], failed: [{email, reason, line}] }

5) Email behavior:
- For each successfully created invite, send the same invite email that single invite uses (or whatever existing email pattern is used).
- If email is not configured, use existing fallback behavior (copy/paste link + mailto), but DO NOT fail the invite creation.

6) UX:
- After submit, show a results summary:
  - “Invited 12 people”
  - “2 failed” with reasons (duplicate email, invalid email, not allowed ministry, etc.)
- Invalidate query cache for /api/team-invites so InviteManagement updates.

7) Confirm no dead ends:
- Invite button should be visible only for users who can actually invite.
- Ensure the created invites appear in InviteManagement (same dataset).
- Ensure invite link continues to be /invite/:token and works.

8) Provide a short test checklist:
- Leader invites 3 people to their ministry via bulk.
- Admin invites 3 people across multiple ministries via bulk.
- Invite accept creates user and assigns selected ministries.
- Failed lines produce clear reasons but don’t block successful lines.

Stop after completing the above. Do not add new unrelated features.
