MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 6
ADMIN + PEOPLE + MINISTRY CLARITY (AUTHORITY, ROLES, REPORTING)
STOP AFTER PHASE 6 REPORT

You have completed Phase 5 successfully. Proceed to Phase 6 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign onboarding UI again.
- Do NOT redesign dashboards again unless explicitly required by admin clarity.
- Do NOT add new major feature domains (rooms/calendar/etc).
- Phase 6 is about PEOPLE STRUCTURE, ADMIN CONTROL, and MINISTRY CLARITY.
- STOP after Phase 6 and return the required output.

GOAL
Make MinistryPath administratively clear, scalable, and understandable:
- Who is an Owner vs Admin vs Pastor vs Leader vs Member
- Who reports to whom
- What ministries exist and how they nest
- What is required of each role
- How leaders see and care for the people assigned to them

---

### A) USER ROLE & AUTHORITY CLEANUP (MANDATORY)

1) Define and enforce a clean role hierarchy:
- Owner (organization creator; can assign/remove other owners)
- Admin (system control, no pastoral authority implied)
- Pastor (spiritual authority, oversight, access to questions & care)
- Leader (ministry leadership, training oversight for assigned people)
- Member (Dream Team Member / Volunteer)
- Intern (optional role, limited authority)

2) Remove legacy/duplicate role aliases where safe.
3) Ensure each user has:
- ONE primary system role
- OPTIONAL additional tags (from Config Bank)

4) Ensure permissions are enforced consistently:
- Owners/Admins access admin backend
- Pastors access care + leadership dashboards
- Leaders access only their ministries and people
- Members do not see admin/leadership UI

---

### B) PEOPLE MANAGEMENT — WHO REPORTS TO WHOM (MANDATORY)

Enhance the People/Admin area to support:

1) Ministry leadership structure:
- Each ministry has:
  - Primary leader
  - Optional co-leaders
- Leaders automatically “own” pastoral/training oversight for people in that ministry

2) For each user profile (admin/leader view):
- Display:
  - Ministries they serve in
  - Their leader(s)
  - Their role(s)
  - Required trainings status
  - Background check status
  - “I Have Questions” submissions (pastor/admin only)

3) Add “Assigned To Me” views:
- Leaders see a list of people they are responsible for
- Pastors see:
  - all leader assignments
  - all “I Have Questions” submissions
- Admins see everything

---

### C) MINISTRY STRUCTURE & EDITING (MANDATORY)

1) Ministries must be fully manageable in Admin:
- Create ministry
- Rename ministry
- Archive ministry
- Assign leader(s)
- Assign parent/child relationships (e.g., Landing Team → Greeters)

2) Ensure system-wide sync:
- Ministry names update everywhere (dashboard, onboarding, training assignment)
- Archived ministries:
  - cannot accept new people
  - do not break existing records

3) Auxiliary ministries:
- Maintain special category
- Allow unique manuals/trainings
- Different onboarding requirements if configured

---

### D) SURVEY → MINISTRY RECOMMENDATION IMPROVEMENT (MANDATORY)

1) Ministry Survey must:
- Use results to recommend ministries that EXIST in this church
- Rank top 3–5 ministry matches
- Respect:
  - availability
  - skills
  - preferences

2) Dashboard + Survey Results page must:
- Show recommended ministries clearly
- Allow “Request to Join” from recommendations
- Notify ministry leader/admin of request

---

### E) ADMIN BACKEND POLISH (MANDATORY)

1) Admin can:
- Update labels (e.g., rename “Dream Team”)
- Add/edit/remove tags
- Add/edit/remove staff titles
- Add/edit/remove serve roles

2) Ensure changes propagate:
- UI labels update instantly
- No hard-coded terminology remains

---

### F) SAFETY & CLARITY

1) Ensure “I Have Questions” submissions:
- Are visible only to Pastors/Admins
- Can be marked as “Reviewed / Followed Up”
- Are linked to the user’s profile

2) Add simple audit notes:
- When a leader/admin updates a role or ministry assignment
- Timestamped (basic)

---

### PHASE 6 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)

1) ROLE HIERARCHY SUMMARY
- final role list
- permission differences

2) PEOPLE MANAGEMENT FEATURES
- what leaders can see
- what pastors can see
- what admins can see

3) MINISTRY STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT
- how ministries are created/edited/archived
- how leaders are assigned

4) SURVEY → MINISTRY MATCHING SUMMARY
- how recommendations are calculated
- how users request to join

5) ADMIN POLISH CONFIRMATION
- labels configurable (yes/no)
- tags configurable (yes/no)
- serve roles configurable (yes/no)

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 6 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 7.”

STOP.
