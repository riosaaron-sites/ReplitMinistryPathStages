MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 4
MEMBER DASHBOARD CLARITY + DISCIPLESHIP SYNC + TRAINING REVIEW + REDUNDANCY CLEANUP
STOP AFTER PHASE 4 REPORT

You have completed Phase 3 verification successfully. Proceed to Phase 4 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign onboarding flow yet (Phase 5).
- Do NOT refactor global roles system yet (later phase).
- Do NOT expand Rooms/Calendar/Meetings/Planning Center in this phase.
- Phase 4 focus is MEMBER experience clarity + removing redundancies.
- You may adjust leadership dashboard only if required for shared components.
- STOP after Phase 4 and return the required output sections.

PHASE 4 OUTCOMES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A) MEMBER DASHBOARD = HOME BASE
Update the member dashboard (/) so it clearly shows:
1) “What’s Next” (top priority panel)
   - Determine next required step using a priority order:
     1) Onboarding incomplete (if any state exists)
     2) Agreement/Faith commitment incomplete
     3) Required core trainings incomplete (About Us, Discipleship Pathway, SERVE, Live the Life, Tell the Story)
     4) Next Night status missing
     5) Following Jesus status missing
     6) Background check incomplete (if required for assigned ministries)
     7) Ministry-specific required trainings incomplete
   - Show as a single clear card with one primary CTA button:
     “Continue” → takes user to the exact next place.

2) “My Trainings” button (prominent)
   - A primary button that opens TrainingHub
   - Must show counts:
     - Required remaining
     - Completed

3) Discipleship Path summary (at a glance)
   - Show steps and current status
   - Make it clickable to open the canonical Discipleship page (see section B)

4) “My Roles / My Ministries” (clean and readable)
   - Show ministry memberships as compact chips/badges
   - Do NOT overload the header/title bar with ministry names
   - If many, show “+N more”

5) Survey results (if present)
   - Show “View My Ministry Survey Results”
   - Show top 3 recommended ministries with “Request to Join” buttons

6) Background Check status
   - If feature exists in DB, surface the status here
   - If no status exists, show “Not on file” / “Pending” appropriately

7) Daily encouragement + Bible verse + optional 365 plan entry
   - Add a small panel that rotates daily based on date (deterministic)
   - Keep simple: verse reference + short encouragement paragraph
   - Optional “Start 365 Bible Plan” link (stub acceptable in Phase 4 if full plan is later)

B) DISCIPLESHIP PAGE — SINGLE CANONICAL EXPERIENCE
Consolidate discipleship into ONE canonical page and remove duplicates:
- Choose canonical route: /my-discipleship (or /journey) but pick ONE and redirect others.
- Merge DiscipleshipPath.tsx and MyDiscipleship.tsx into one coherent experience.

Requirements for the canonical discipleship page:
1) Expandable steps with explanations and user contribution details
   - Sunday attendance does NOT expand (just status)
   - Next Night expands:
     - date attended (from user data)
     - notes optional
   - Learn expands:
     - Following Jesus completion (date/status)
     - links to required core trainings
     - shows what remains
   - Love expands:
     - serving involvement summary
     - links to community care / follow-up concepts if present
   - Lead expands:
     - leadership training requirements (for leaders/pastors)
2) Each step must show:
   - “What this is”
   - “Your status”
   - “What to do next” (with a button that launches the exact action)

3) Training sync
   - Learn step must reflect training completion:
     - if core trainings complete, show Learn as progressing/complete
     - if Following Jesus required and incomplete, show it as blocking

C) TRAININGS — REVIEWABILITY + CLARITY
1) TrainingHub must clearly separate:
   - Required
   - Optional
   - Completed (reviewable)
2) Completed trainings must be reopenable from the Completed list
3) Show clear progress indicators without stale-state bugs
4) Ensure no dead links into TrainingViewer

D) REMOVE REDUNDANCY / DEAD ENDS
Remove or consolidate truly redundant pages identified in audit:
- OnboardingHub.tsx (if unused)
- MyProgress.tsx (if overlaps)
- ProfileWizard.tsx (if overlaps)
- duplicate discipleship route aliases beyond the chosen canonical redirect
- remove unnecessary nav links that lead to “glitter” or duplicate concepts
Be conservative: prefer redirect + deprecate before deleting, but delete truly unused code.

E) HEADER/TITLE BAR CLEANUP
- Stop showing all connected ministries in the title bar or top UI areas.
- Keep the header simple:
  - logo/name
  - nav
  - user menu
- Ministry badges belong inside dashboard/profile cards, not the global header.

PHASE 4 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)
1) DASHBOARD CHANGES SUMMARY
- list panels added/updated
- “What’s Next” logic summary
- where “My Trainings” button routes

2) DISCIPLESHIP CANONICALIZATION
- which route is canonical
- which routes redirect
- which components were merged/deleted

3) TRAINING HUB REVIEWABILITY
- confirm Completed section exists
- confirm reopen completed training works

4) REDUNDANCY CLEANUP LIST
- files deleted
- routes removed/redirected
- links removed from nav

5) HEADER CLEANUP CONFIRMATION
- what was removed from header/title bar

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 4 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 5.”

STOP.
