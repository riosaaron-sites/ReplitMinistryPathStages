Update the Training Approval workflow to support “continue to next training” without granting completion/advancement until ministry leader approval.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Allow progression:
   - If a training requiresApproval=true and the member submits it (status=submitted), the UI should immediately offer a “Continue to Next Training” action.
   - Being able to start the next training must NOT depend on the previous being approved.

2) Prevent advancement:
   - XP, badges, certifications, role eligibility, “path completion,” and any other rewards/advancement MUST NOT trigger for submitted status.
   - Only trigger rewards/advancement when:
     a) requiresApproval=false AND status=completed
     b) requiresApproval=true AND leader approves AND status transitions to approved

3) Correct leader-by-ministry approval enforcement (server-side):
   - Each training is associated with a ministry (training.ministryId or equivalent).
   - Only users who are leaders of that SAME ministry may approve or reject that submitted training.
   - If a leader from another ministry attempts approval/rejection, return 403.
   - Admin/Owner may optionally override, but ONLY via a clearly labeled “Admin Override” endpoint/UI that requires an extra confirmation.

4) Ministry-scoped review queue:
   - Build/adjust the leader review inbox so leaders only see submissions for trainings tied to ministries they lead.
   - The submission list should show: trainee name, training title, submittedAt, and an “Open for Review” action.

5) UI clarity:
   - Submitted state should say: “Awaiting review by <Ministry Name> Leader”
   - Include a “Continue to Next Training” button if a next training exists in the path/sequence.
   - If the next training is also approval-required, that is fine—keep the same rules.

6) Tests:
   - Add tests ensuring:
     - submitted does not grant rewards
     - leader of correct ministry can approve
     - leader of wrong ministry cannot approve (403)
     - trainee can start next training while prior is submitted

DELIVERABLES:
- Implement changes in code (backend enforcement + UI).
- End with “What changed” and “How to test in the app”.
- Do not require shell commands or manual DB work by the user.
