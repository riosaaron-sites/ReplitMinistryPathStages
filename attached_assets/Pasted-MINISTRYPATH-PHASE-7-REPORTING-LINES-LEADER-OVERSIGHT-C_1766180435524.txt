MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 7
REPORTING LINES + LEADER OVERSIGHT + COLLAB ACTION ITEMS + (OPTIONAL) SERVING METRICS
STOP AFTER PHASE 7 REPORT

You have completed Phase 6 successfully. Proceed to Phase 7 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT rebuild the app.
- Do NOT redesign onboarding again.
- Do NOT redesign the member dashboard again beyond adding reporting-line clarity.
- Keep UI simple and accessible.
- STOP after Phase 7 and provide the required output.

PRIMARY GOALS
A) Make “who I report to” obvious for members
B) Give leaders/pastors clean oversight views (“assigned to me”)
C) Add the Action Items / Collaboration tool you requested (meeting workboard)
D) Add serving metrics visibility (Planning Center-lite) using existing stubs/tables when possible; otherwise implement local tracking as Phase 7 foundation

---

## A) MEMBER: “WHO I REPORT TO” + EXPECTATIONS (MANDATORY)

1) On member dashboard and My Roles page:
- For each ministry badge/chip, show:
  - Ministry name
  - “Reports to: <Leader Name>” (primary leader)
  - Optional: co-leader(s)
- Include a short “What’s expected of me” snippet for each ministry:
  - pulled from the linked ministry manual/training description
  - if not available, show a simple default + link to the training

2) Keep it clean:
- Do NOT create giant title strings
- Use compact cards or expandable sections

---

## B) LEADER/PASTOR: OVERSIGHT VIEWS (MANDATORY)

Create a “My People” (leader) and “Care & Oversight” (pastor) experience.

LEADER VIEW (for leader role):
- A list of people in leader’s ministries
- Columns/fields:
  - Name
  - Ministries served
  - Required trainings remaining
  - Background check status
  - Last activity (training, login, message) if available
- Actions:
  - message user (internal message)
  - view profile
  - mark follow-up note (private to leader/pastor)

PASTOR VIEW (for pastor/owner):
- Global oversight:
  - All leaders and their assigned people counts
  - Unresolved “I Have Questions”
  - Pending ministry join requests
  - Users stuck in onboarding (if any)
- Actions:
  - assign/reassign ministry leaders
  - assign a person to a leader (via ministry leadership structure)

---

## C) COLLAB ACTION ITEMS TOOL (MANDATORY)

You requested:
“Find, track and complete action items. Collaborate. Example: Community Care team collaborating with Children’s ministry… deadlines… resources…”

Implement a simple, powerful collaboration tool:
- “Workboard” feature:
  - Create a board per ministry or cross-ministry project
  - Each board contains:
    - agenda / notes
    - action items with:
      - owner
      - due date
      - status (open/in progress/done)
      - comments thread
- Must be usable during a live meeting
- Keep it very easy (no complex kanban required; simple list is fine)

Integration points:
- Boards can be linked to a Meeting record (if meetings exist)
- Leaders/pastors can create boards; members can participate if added

---

## D) SERVING METRICS VISIBILITY (PLANNING CENTER-LITE) — FOUNDATION

User requirement:
Users should see how often they serve and accept/decline/ignore.

Implement one of two options:

Option 1 (preferred): If Planning Center stub tables exist
- Create a “Serving Metrics” panel on member dashboard showing:
  - times scheduled (last 90 days)
  - accepted
  - declined
  - no response
  - most common positions served
- Provide placeholders if external sync not connected yet, but keep structure.

Option 2 (fallback): Local tracking
- Allow leaders to log service participation manually:
  - date
  - ministry
  - position
  - status (accepted/declined/no response/served)
- Then compute the same metrics.

Keep it simple and reliable.

---

## E) UI & DESIGN CONSISTENCY
- Use Montserrat, palette (#f2660f, #223134, #424242)
- Keep screens uncluttered
- Add small instruction boxes where needed

---

PHASE 7 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)

1) MEMBER REPORTING-LINE DISPLAY
- where it appears
- how leader is determined

2) LEADER/PASTOR OVERSIGHT VIEWS
- routes/pages added
- what leaders see
- what pastors see

3) WORKBOARD TOOL
- what it supports (agenda + action items)
- permissions
- meeting linkage (yes/no)

4) SERVING METRICS IMPLEMENTATION
- which option implemented (Planning Center stub vs local tracking)
- where metrics show
- what fields are tracked

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 7 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 8.”

STOP.
