ADD-ON PROMPT: Rooms, Calendar, People & Roles, Ministries, Metrics, Archiving, and Reporting Logic

PRIORITY BUILDER NOTE:
Implement these features immediately. If partial versions exist, refine and expand them — do NOT delete working modules.

✅ 1. Rooms & Calendar Enhancements
A. Rooms Management Must Allow:

Add new rooms

Edit existing rooms

Delete rooms (only if not used in historical data; otherwise archive the room)

Set room capacity

Upload or draw mock room layouts

Modify tables, chairs, layouts

B. Room Requests Must Include:

Requested room

Date & time

Ministry or event

Setup diagram

Capacity or special needs

Approval workflow

C. Calendar Integration:

When a room is requested AND approved:

It must automatically appear on the calendar

Show conflicts if the room is already booked

Provide a “Room Conflict” alert to the requestor

Provide manual override for Admin

D. Editing Rooms Must Not Break Existing Data

If a room is edited:

Update capacity/layout without erasing history

Maintain legacy bookings

If deleted → convert to “archived room”

Archived rooms remain accessible in reporting

Not available for future booking

✅ 2. People & Roles Module Enhancements
GLOBAL REQUIREMENT:

You must be able to view ANY user’s:

Profile

Ministry roles

Training journey

Onboarding checklist

Background check status (if applicable)

Survey results

Attendance or activity data required by their ministries

A. Archiving Users

Ability to Archive a user for up to 180 days

Archived users are hidden from normal views

Searchable ONLY when filters include “Archived Users”

After 180 days → app prompts Admin whether to:

Extend archive

Permanently delete

Restore

B. Deleting Users

Hard-delete only allowed by Admin.
Before deleting, show a required warning:

“Deleting this user will permanently remove all data, progress, surveys, and history. This action cannot be undone.”

C. Symbols for User Task Status

Next to names, add a visual indicator:

Yellow dot = onboarding incomplete

Red dot = required tasks overdue

Green dot = fully trained & active

Blue dot = archived

These should appear in lists, ministry rosters, and dashboards.

✅ 3. Ministries Module Enhancements
When clicking a ministry, display:

Comprehensive description of the ministry

Ministry Leader profile

List of all team members

Click-through access to each member’s profile

Ability to message any individual directly from this screen

Required trainings for this ministry

Completion status of team members

Add Ministry Workflow

Admins can create a ministry

For 7 days, ministry can be edited or deleted

After 7 days:

Ministry becomes permanent

It cannot be deleted

Only archived

Archiving a ministry hides it from active views but retains:

Training records

Roster

Attendance metrics

Messages

Archiving Ministry Logic

If archived:

Users who were in that ministry retain training history

They lose access to that ministry’s dashboard

The ministry no longer appears in onboarding or role selection

✅ 4. Metrics & Attendance Reporting Module
Every Ministry Leader must be able to report attendance and metrics, including:

Attendance count

Number of volunteers

First-time guests

Salvations (if applicable)

Decisions or responses

Baptisms

Notes from the event

Offering (if relevant to ministry)

Any ministry-specific custom metrics defined by the leader

First-Time Setup:

When creating a recurring reportable activity (e.g., “Sunday Youth Service”), leaders must define:

Name of activity

Ministry

Location

Time

Frequency (weekly, monthly, biweekly, custom)

Recurrence pattern

Who is responsible

Whether attendance is required

Ministry-specific questions

After Setup:

Leaders do NOT have to re-enter setup information again.
They simply enter the numbers.

🚨 REPORTING LOGIC & REMINDERS
Submit Deadline:

Leaders have 48 hours after an event to submit data.

If not submitted:

The system automatically sends:

A reminder after 48 hours

Another reminder every 24 hours

Until data is submitted

If the event did NOT happen:

Leader selects:

“Event did not occur”

Then selects reason:

Weather

Cancelled by leadership

Volunteer shortage

Holiday

Other (type reason)

If event is canceled for a season (e.g., mid-summer):

Leader may “Snooze reporting” with:

Start date

End date

During snooze period:

User receives NO reminders

Reporting dashboard displays:

“This event was snoozed from [date] to [date].”

Editing Submitted Reports

Leaders must be able to:

Edit a previous submission

Provide a reason for editing

Audit log must store:

Original submission

Updated submission

Who made the change

Time and date

Deleting Reports

Not allowed unless by Admin
Deleted reports must log the action in the audit trail.

🧹 5. Logical Data Integrity Requirements
Deleting or archiving must NEVER break data.

Implement:

Safe archival

Historical protection

Versioning of reports

Ability to restore archived items

Read-only access to archived data

Summary of Protection Rules:

Users can only be permanently deleted manually after explicit warning

Ministries cannot be deleted after 7 days — only archived

Rooms cannot be deleted if attached to history — only archived

Reporting history cannot be deleted except by Admin

Snoozing preserves historical accuracy

🎯 BUILDER DIRECTIVE (Add to end of prompt)

Builder must ensure that all modules—Rooms, Calendar, People & Roles, Ministries, Metrics, Reporting, Archiving—are deeply integrated with the existing MinistryPath system so that users never hit a dead end, all data remains intact, and leaders can monitor training, attendance, and activity with clarity and ease.
