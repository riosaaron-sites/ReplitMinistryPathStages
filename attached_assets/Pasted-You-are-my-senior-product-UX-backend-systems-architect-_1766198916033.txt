You are my senior product + UX + backend systems architect for MinistryPath (Garden City Church, Beverly MA). The platform is built and launch-ready. You are NOT to rehash build history unless directly relevant. Your job is to produce a thorough, actionable post-launch improvement plan and the exact implementation spec (data model, permissions, UI behavior, notifications, reset plan) based on the requirements below.

CONTEXT (do not rewrite, just use):
- MinistryPath is a custom church platform with roles: Owner, Admin, Pastor, Leader, Member, Intern, Attendee.
- Onboarding: welcome → profile → ministry → faith commitment → classes → completion.
- Clear “What’s Next” logic exists but needs improvements to navigation/connection.
- Trainings, assessments, discipleship path, health indicators, workboard, resources, help center, and admin backend are implemented.
- Phase 8 complete; system is functionally launch-ready. No new feature development unless explicitly requested.

GOAL:
Prioritize post-launch improvements that fix coherence, authority, data linkage, onboarding freshness, and leader workflows—without overbuilding. Deliver a plan that is implementable immediately.

KNOWN ISSUES / REQUIREMENTS:
1) People Directory vs Admin People Panel must be unified
- The church directory (People view) is disconnected from the Admin People panel.
- There must be ONE canonical Person/User record as source of truth.
- Admin must have global authority over directory people: view/edit/delete anyone.
- Pastors and Leaders must have global VIEW of everyone (read-only by default).
- Pastors and Leaders may only MODIFY/DELETE:
  a) people they personally invited/added, OR
  b) people directly under ministries they lead (their team).
- Dream Team Members may only VIEW people in their own ministry team(s); they should not see other teams.
- Directory must always reflect Admin edits/deletes.

2) Profile sections must be clickable and connected (navigation + meaning)
In “My Profile,” these sections must be intuitive and connected, not static:
- Ministry Roles
- Training History
- My Journey
Each must be clickable and take the user to the relevant canonical section:
- Ministry Roles → role detail + expectations + reporting line + ministry context
- Training History → Training Hub filtered to completed/in progress/recommended
- My Journey → Discipleship Path with current stage and next step
Also specify: correct empty states and explanations.

3) Full profile reset + correct linkage
- I need all profiles fully reset and everything linked correctly.
- Provide a safe plan to wipe all test users and their dependent records while preserving:
  configuration, roles, tags, manuals, trainings, help center content, resources library, discipleship path definitions.
- The reset must avoid orphaned records and ensure referential integrity.
- After reset, onboarding must feel fresh and coherent.

4) Fresh onboarding experience
- Propose improvements to onboarding to make it feel pastoral, clear, and guided.
- Do NOT add unnecessary steps. Improve clarity, sequencing, and “why this matters.”
- Ensure onboarding correctly sets:
  ministries, roles (if applicable), faith commitment, class status, journey stage.
- “What’s Next” prompts must correctly direct users to where they can complete items (e.g., update status should deep-link to Journey completion action).

5) Leader invite / leadership scope / onboarding notifications
- When inviting or welcoming new Leaders, I need to specify what ministry/ministry roles they LEAD.
- When a new person onboards into a given ministry, the leader(s) of that ministry must be notified:
  a) in-app notification
  b) email notification to the leader’s profile email
- Notifications must be pastoral, non-shaming, clear on next action.
- Define when notifications trigger (e.g., ministry selection complete, onboarding completion, first serve signup, etc.).
- Ensure leaders can manage/modify/delete people under their ministries (permission rules above).

6) Messaging Center
- The message center must allow ALL users to contact ANYONE in the entire system.
- Messaging search/recipient selection is global, regardless of directory visibility limits.
- Directory visibility and messaging permissions are separate.

DELIVERABLES (must be thorough):
A) Canonical data model + entity relationships
- Define Person/User model and relationships: roles, ministries, ministryMemberships, leadershipAssignments, invitations, audit logs, notifications, messages.
- Include key fields needed to enforce permissions: createdBy, invitedBy, ministryId(s), leaderOfMinistryId(s), reportingLine, etc.
- Describe referential integrity rules and cascade delete strategy.

B) Permissions matrix (explicit, unambiguous)
- Table: Role × Capability (view directory, edit profile, delete user, view team, view all, message all, assign ministries, reset users).
- Include special cases: Owner protected account, admin reset tool safety, pastors/leaders global view but scoped edit/delete.

C) “People” system unification plan
- Explain how to merge the Admin People panel and Directory into one source of truth.
- Outline required changes to queries, endpoints, and UI.
- Include migration steps if needed.

D) Profile UX wiring spec
- Exactly how each Profile section links and what filters/context it passes.
- Define empty states and guidance text.

E) Reset + relaunch plan
- Step-by-step reset checklist.
- Dry-run counts, safety confirmations, owner protection.
- Post-reset smoke tests to confirm linkage, onboarding, permissions, directory, and messaging.
- Suggested soft relaunch sequence (leaders first, then teams).

F) Notification spec (in-app + email)
- Event triggers
- Recipient selection logic
- Message templates (short pastoral drafts)
- Rate limiting / avoiding spam
- Audit trail

G) Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Provide clear test cases for each requirement (e.g., a Leader can view all people but can only edit X; Dream Team can only see their ministry; messaging works globally; deleting in admin removes from directory; profile links work; onboarding deep links work).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
1) Executive summary (bullet list of highest impact fixes first)
2) Priority backlog (High/Medium/Low) with effort estimates (S/M/L) and dependencies
3) The full implementation spec sections A–G above
4) A final “Launch Confidence Checklist”

CONSTRAINTS:
- Pastoral tone, simple language, accessible for teens to seniors.
- Do not shame users; encourage and guide.
- Avoid overbuilding; stick to requirements.
- Assume the platform is already built; this is post-launch improvement + coherence work.

START NOW. Do not ask clarifying questions—make reasonable assumptions and clearly state them where needed.
