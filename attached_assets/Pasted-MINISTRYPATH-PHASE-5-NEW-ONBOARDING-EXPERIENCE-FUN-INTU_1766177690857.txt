MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 5
NEW ONBOARDING EXPERIENCE (FUN, INTUITIVE, GUIDED) + SIMPLIFY FLOW
STOP AFTER PHASE 5 REPORT

You have completed Phase 4.1 successfully. Proceed to Phase 5 ONLY.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT change manual/training generation logic in this phase.
- Do NOT redesign dashboards in this phase beyond “welcome completion” routing.
- Do NOT expand Rooms/Calendar/Meetings/Planning Center in this phase.
- This phase is ONLY: onboarding experience redesign + clarity + instruction boxes.
- Preserve existing onboarding fields and data capture.
- STOP after Phase 5 and return the required output.

GOAL (IN PLAIN ENGLISH)
Replace the current onboarding experience with a modern guided onboarding flow that:
- feels like “you’ve been invited into the inner circle”
- is easy for teens and seniors
- uses clear progress steps, friendly explanations, and minimal friction
- ends with a celebration moment, then routes to the dashboard

REQUIREMENTS

A) NEW ONBOARDING “WELCOME” ENTRY (MANDATORY)
Create a new first screen before ProfileStep:
Route: /onboarding/welcome (or similar)
Includes:
- Welcome message
- What MinistryPath is (3–5 bullets)
- What you’ll do next (Profile → Ministry → Commitment → Classes)
- A “Start Onboarding” button
- Progress indicator (Step 0 of N)

B) PROGRESS UI (MANDATORY)
Across all onboarding steps:
- Show progress bar and step names
- Keep steps consistent and minimal
- Clear “Back” and “Continue”

C) KEEP SAME DATA, IMPROVE PRESENTATION
You must keep the data capture that already exists, but improve layout and clarity:

1) ProfileStep
- Clear sections: Contact, Photo (optional), Social (optional)
- Inline help text and examples (short)
- “Skip optional” supported

2) MinistriesStep
- Show invited ministry(ies) prominently if present
- Allow request-to-join additional ministries only if feature exists, otherwise show “available later”
- Explain who they report to (if ministry leader exists)
- Explain basic expectations in 2–3 bullets

3) Faith Commitment step
- Keep doctrinal wizard, but improve readability:
  - one concept per screen
  - short description
  - scripture reference displayed cleanly
  - clear confirm action
- Add an “I have questions” optional text field:
  - stored to user profile and visible to leaders/admins

4) ClassStatusStep
- Make it simple:
  - Next Night: attended date or planned
  - Following Jesus: attended date or planned
- Add clear explanation why these matter

5) PhotoStep
- Keep optional; keep skip button
- If photo already exists, auto-skip remains fine

D) INSTRUCTION BOXES (MANDATORY)
Every onboarding page must include a small “Need help?” expandable panel:
- Simple instructions
- Contact or “Ask for Help” link if available
- Keep it unobtrusive

E) COMPLETION MOMENT (MANDATORY)
After final onboarding step:
- Show a completion screen:
  - “You’re in.”
  - A short encouragement
  - “Go to Dashboard” button
- Then route to dashboard

F) SIMPLIFY GATING LOGIC
Currently gating is split across router and step components.
- Consolidate gating to ONE source of truth (OnboardingController).
- Remove redundant redirects where safe.
- Ensure no infinite loops.

G) DESIGN SYSTEM
Use Montserrat and existing palette:
- #f2660f highlights
- #223134 borders/boxes
- #424242 secondary text
Keep clean, friendly, accessible (large tap targets).

PHASE 5 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)
1) NEW ONBOARDING FLOW MAP
- list steps and routes in order

2) UI/UX CHANGES SUMMARY
- what was redesigned
- what stayed the same (data-wise)

3) GATING SIMPLIFICATION
- what was consolidated
- what was removed

4) ACCESSIBILITY/MOBILE NOTES
- confirm tap targets and mobile layout

End with this exact sentence:
“Phase 5 complete. Awaiting authorization to proceed to Phase 6.”

STOP.
