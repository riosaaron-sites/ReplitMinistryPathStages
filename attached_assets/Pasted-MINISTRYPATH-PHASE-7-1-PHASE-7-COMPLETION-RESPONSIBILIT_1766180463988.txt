MINISTRYPATH — PHASE 7.1
PHASE 7 COMPLETION: RESPONSIBILITY CLARITY, WORKBOARD MATURITY, MEANINGFUL METRICS
STOP AFTER PHASE 7.1 REPORT

This phase EXTENDS Phase 7. Do NOT undo existing work.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT redesign onboarding or dashboards wholesale.
- Do NOT remove existing Phase 7 features.
- This phase ADDS clarity, interpretation, and usability.
- STOP after Phase 7.1 and return the required report.

GOALS
Finish Phase 7 so that:
- Leaders clearly know who they are responsible for and what “healthy” looks like
- Members clearly know what is expected of them
- Collaboration tools feel usable in real ministry meetings
- Serving metrics are meaningful, not just numeric
- The platform begins to pastor, not just track

---

## A) LEADER RESPONSIBILITY & HEALTH INDICATORS (MANDATORY)

Enhance leader views to include:

1) Ministry Expectations Panel
- For each ministry:
  - Display 3–5 expectation bullets
  - Source from:
    - ministry manual summary OR
    - default expectations if not defined
- Visible to:
  - members (read-only)
  - leaders (editable via admin)

2) People Health Indicators (Leader View)
For each person under a leader:
- Show a simple status:
  - 🟢 Healthy
  - 🟡 Needs Attention
  - 🔴 Inactive / Follow-up Needed
Calculated from:
- training completion
- serving activity
- unanswered “I Have Questions”
- onboarding completeness

No shaming language. Keep pastoral tone.

---

## B) WORKBOARD — MEETING MODE & MINISTRY MODE (MANDATORY)

Extend Workboard with two modes:

1) Meeting Mode
- Agenda section (time-ordered)
- Discussion notes (freeform)
- Decisions section (what was decided)
- Action Items auto-generated from decisions

2) Ministry Mode
- Ongoing initiatives
- Tasks can be assigned to:
  - individuals OR
  - entire ministries
- Due dates + status

Visual clarity:
- Very simple layout
- No kanban overload
- Senior-friendly

---

## C) SERVING METRICS — INTERPRETATION LAYER (MANDATORY)

Enhance serving metrics to include:

1) Member View
- “Your Serving Summary”
  - last 90 days
  - encouragement-based messaging
  - trend arrow (up/down/steady)

2) Leader View
- “Team Serving Health”
  - spot under-engagement
  - spot over-serving (burnout risk)
- Filter by ministry

Metrics should say:
- what happened
- what it means
- what to do next

---

## D) FEEDBACK & ENCOURAGEMENT LOOP (MANDATORY)

Add a lightweight feedback feature:
- Leaders can leave:
  - encouragement notes
  - “reviewed” acknowledgments
- Triggered by:
  - training completion
  - survey review
  - question follow-up

Members see:
- “Leader Feedback” section
- Timestamped
- Encouraging tone only

---

## E) UI & TONE CHECK
- Ensure language remains pastoral, not corporate
- No guilt-driven phrasing
- Keep everything readable and calm

---

PHASE 7.1 REQUIRED OUTPUT (RETURN ONLY THIS)

1) LEADER RESPONSIBILITY ADDITIONS
- expectations display (yes/no)
